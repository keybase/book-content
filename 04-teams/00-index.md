# Keybase for Teams
Use Teams to work, connect, organize. A team on Keybase is simply a group of people—colleagues, cabals, families, flashmobs, magic circles—any group.

Teams can [chat](/chat), use [files](/files), and [collaborate on Git](/Git).

Like everything else on Keybase, your team chats, files, and Git are end-to-end encrypted. What you and your team share, store, and commit stays between you and your team. 

Likewise, person-to-person interactions remain private. Team admins or owners can’t access individual chats between team members or any other interactions they’re not explicitly a part of. No snooping—anywhere, ever—on Keybase.

## Creating a team
Before you create a team, there are a few things you should know:
* Teams are public. Outsiders can see that they exist but not necessarily who is in them.
* Team members can choose to publish the teams they belong to on their profiles.
* Team names cannot be changed.

### Adding and removing people
You can create a team from scratch. Or if your team’s on Slack, you can [import it into Keybase](https://keybase.io/slack-importer/).

Adding people by Keybase username is the quickest way to create a team. If you add people by their social handle, email, or phone numbers, they’ll need to create a Keybase account if they don’t already have one. 

As you add people to a team, they’re announced in the team chat. All new team members can search and read the entire team chat history, except for exploding messages sent before they joined.

If you remove a team member, they lose access to all team chats and folders. Removed team members cannot rejoin a team unless an admin adds them again.

### Roles and permissions
When you add someone to a team, you’ll assign them a role that gives them specific permissions. In most cases, most people should be writers, unless you’re managing a community. Then, you might want your team members to be readers. You can always change roles later.

## Leaving a team
If you leave a team, any messages and files you shared remain with the team, but you lose access to them. You can only rejoin a team if you are invited by an admin or owner.

## Deleting a team
A team can only be deleted by the team owner. A team can only be deleted if there are no subteams. If a team or subteam is deleted, all team chats are lost forever, all data in the team folder(s) is lost forever, and all team members are notified.
