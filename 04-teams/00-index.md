{% set section_title = "Teams" %}
A team on Keybase is simply a group of people. For example, an organization or company, a group of friends, or an open community with a shared interest can all be teams.
 
Chats and files are automatically created for every new team. Teams can also use Git on Keybase. Like everything else on Keybase, your team chats, files, and Git are secure and end-to-end encrypted. What you and your team say and share cannot be compromised — it all stays between you and your team. Likewise, individual, person-to-person interactions also remain encrypted and private. A team admin or owner can never access private replies or any other interactions they are not explicitly a part of. 

Teams can be categorized as big teams, subteams, and open teams.

## Big teams
If you create channels for a chat, your team becomes a big team (no matter how many people are in it, even a team of two can be a big team). Chats for big teams appear in the lower part of your inbox. 

Channels are a way to organize chats. They’re useful for focused conversations on say, a specific project or lunch ideas, but they are not private. Everyone on a team can search and read all messages and files shared in any and every channel. To privately chat or share files, you need to create a subteam. 

## Subteams
A subteam is a group of people created from within a team. A subteam does not need to include all members of a team. A subteam can also include people from outside of a team. For example, an organization may want to create subteams for a particular team and a hiring committee. These subteams might be named `patagonia.design` and `patagonia.design.hiring`.

Essentially, subteams are a way to create private chats and folders within teams. And while teams are public (outsiders may see that they exist but can’t necessarily see everyone who is in them), subteams can be completely hidden from anyone who isn’t in them. 

Just like teams, subteams can become a “big team” by adding chat channels. But permissions and roles work a little differently. Only team owners and admins can make subteams. Subteams do not have owners. Subteams may have implicit admins, people who are admins of the parent team but not of this subteam. Implicit admins do not have access to files and chats shared within a subteam.

{# Docs say this: “An implicit admin of a subteam who hasn’t been explicitly added to the subteam does not get access to server-gated keys for that team, and therefore does not get access to KBFS and chat data. Thus, a subteam can avoid dangerous situations in which all of its members have lost their access to data.” BUT implicit admins can delete subteams, which would delete all of their files and chats. #} 

## Open teams
If you’re building a community, you can make an open team that anyone can join. If you like, you can also publicize it to the Keybase community. 

If you know of an open team you’d like to join, for example keybasefriends or stellar.public, you can hit `Join a team` to request being added. Since you can’t necessarily see who is on a team, Keybase pings the admin for you. The admin can accept or ignore your request.
