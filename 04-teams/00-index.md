# Teams

Some concepts this chapter needs to cover:

* A team is a group of people
* Each person has different access rights
* Teams have (verify this) 2 features: chat and files
* A team with one channel behaves in the UI like a group chat
* A team with two or more channels is a big team (Keybase term; we could suggest changes) and is listed separately at the bottom of the UI
* A subteam is a defined group of people that is owned by the parent team, but does not include everyone from the team.
* Subteams can have people outside of the team. Keybase has one for their board, for example.
* (Verify this) People with admin access for the team can join any subteam, but not secretly. It's very clear who has access.
* Subteams can have their own channels. (Can they also have files?)
