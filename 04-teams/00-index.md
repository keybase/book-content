{% set section_title = "Teams" %}
A team on Keybase is simply a group of people. For example, an organization or company, a group of friends, or an open community with a shared interest can all be teams.
 
Teams are categorized as small teams, big teams, and subteams. Chats and files are automatically created for every new team. Teams can also use Git on Keybase. 
 
Like everything else on Keybase, your team chats, files, and Git are secure and end-to-end encrypted. What you and your team say and share cannot be compromised â€” it all stays between you and your team. Likewise, individual, person-to-person interactions also remain encrypted and private. A team admin or owner can never access private replies or any other interactions they are not explicitly a part of.
