# Teams
A team on Keybase is simply a group of people. For example, an organization or company, a group of friends, or an open community with a shared interest can all be teams.
 
Teams are categorized as small teams, big teams, and subteams. [Chats](link to chat section) and [files](link to files section) are automatically created for every new team. Teams can also use [Git](link to Git section). 
 
Like everything else on Keybase, your team chats, file sharing, and [Git] are secure and end-to-end encrypted. What you and your team say and share cannot be compromised â€” it all stays between you and your team. Likewise, individual, person-to-person interactions also remain encrypted and private. A team admin or owner can never access private replies or any other interactions they are not explicitly a part of.
