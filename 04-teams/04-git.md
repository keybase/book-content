## Git for teams
Keybase supports free, encrypted, authenticated, and private Git repositories. These repositories are especially useful for sharing secret or private content within teams. Repositories shared with teams can be viewed in the Keybase app. Theyâ€™re totally secure and private. 

To see a demo, ask to join the team `keybasefriends`.
