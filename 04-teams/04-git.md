## Git for Teams
Git for Teams on Keybase works pretty much the same way it works for individuals. Learn more in [Git](/git).

Git repositories on Keybase are free, encrypted, authenticated, and private. Theyâ€™re especially useful for sharing secret or private content within teams. Repositories shared with teams can be viewed in the Keybase app. 

To see a demo, ask to join the team `keybasefriends`.
