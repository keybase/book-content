## Chat for Teams
Chat for Teams works pretty much the same way it does for individuals. Learn more in [Chat](/chat).
 
A chat is automatically created for each team. Team members with the right permissions can organize chats with channels and manage chat privacy.

### Channels 
Everyone on a team (except readers) can create channels to organize team chats. If you add a channel to a team chat, your team becomes a big team (and the chat moves to the lower part of your inbox).

Everyone on a team can read messages and files shared in any team channel. 

If you delete a chat channel, all messages will be lost and gone forever.

### Privacy
Everyone on a team can search and read all of the messages and files shared in team chats. But when team members chat directly with each other, their messages remain private. Team owners or admins canâ€™t access private chats. 

By default, your entire chat history is saved and searchable forever. But team owners can manage how long messages are saved. Messages can be auto-deleted never or at set intervals as short as 30 seconds and as long as 365 days. 

To keep chats or files private to specific team members, create a subteam.
