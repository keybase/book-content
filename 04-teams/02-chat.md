A chat is automatically created for each team. Chat for teams works pretty much the same as it does for individuals on Keybase but there are a couple nice things to know.
 
For one, team members can reply privately to messages within team chats. Those messages always remain private between those two individuals. Team owners or admins can never access private chats. You can also create private group chats within a team by making a subteam.
 
Otherwise, team chats have access to all the special features as other chats: files, location sharing, coin flips, and exploding messages.

## Channels
Channels can be used to organize team chats. If you add a channel to a team chat, your team becomes a big team and the chat moves to the lower part of your inbox. 
 
Everyone on a team, except readers, can create channels. And — we’re mentioning this again because it’s important — everyone on a team can read messages and files shared in any team channel. (To create chats or share files that are private to specific team members, you need to make a subteam.) 
 
If you delete a chat channel, all messages will be lost and gone forever.
 
## Chat history
The entire saved history of messages and files shared within team chats is searchable and readable by everyone on a team (except for exploded messages, of course). Team owners determine the length of messages history. Messages can be auto-deleted never, or at set intervals as short as 30 seconds and as long as 365 days.
