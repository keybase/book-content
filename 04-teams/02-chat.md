## Chat for teams
A chat is automatically created for each team. Chat for teams on Keybase works pretty much the same as it does for individuals, but there are a couple nice things to know.

For one, team members can reply privately to messages within team chats. Those messages always remain private between those two individuals. Team owners or admins can’t access private chats. In other words: the big cheese can’t spy. You can also create private group chats within a team by making a subteam.

And of course, team chats have access to all the [special features](/chat/features). Learn more in [Chat](/chat).

### Organizing with channels
Channels can be used to organize team chats. If you add a channel to a team chat, your team becomes a big team (and the chat moves to the lower part of your inbox).

Everyone on a team (except readers) can create channels. And everyone on a team can read messages and files shared in any team channel. To have chats or files that are private to specific team members, make a subteam.

If you delete a chat channel, all messages will be lost and gone forever.

### Chat history
The entire saved history of messages and files shared within team chats is searchable and readable by everyone on a team (except for exploded messages, of course).

Team owners determine the length of message history. Messages can be auto-deleted never, or at set intervals as short as 30 seconds and as long as 365 days.
