# Chat
A chat is automatically created for each new team. Until you create channels, a team chat appears the same as an individual chat [at the top of your “inbox”]. 

Each new member added is announced in the team chat. When you add channels to a team chat, your team becomes and is grouped as a “big team” [in the lower part of your inbox].  **Everyone on a team can read and search all chats and files in all channels**. 

To create chats [or files] that are private to specific team members, you need to make a subteam. Subteams can also include members who are not a part of the initial team. 

Individual team members can reply privately to messages within team chats. [Hit the three dots to the upper-right of a message and select Reply privately. That chat moves up to the top of your inbox with other “small team” messages]. Those messages always remain private between those two individuals. 

In addition to channels and subteams, team chats have access to all the same features as other chats: files, GIFS, location sharing, coin flips, and exploding messages.

## Channels
Channels can be used to organize team chats. If you add a channel to a team chat, your team becomes a big team [and the inbox moves to the lower part of the sidebar]. 

Everyone on a team, except readers, can create channels. And — we’re mentioning this again because it’s important — everyone on a team can read and access messages and files shared in any team channel. (To create chats or share files that are private to specific team members, you need to [make a subteam](link to subteam section).) 

**To create a chat channel:**
1. [Hit the gear icon to the right of the team name / TK different experiences on mobile and desktop.]
2. Select Manage or Create chat channels. 

Manage chat channels also allows you to delete chat channels. If you delete a chat channel, all messages will be lost and gone forever.

## Notifications
You can manage the chat notifications you do or don’t want to receive for every chat or channel. Notifications can be sent to your desktop or mobile device. When chat notifications are sent, they only share that a message was posted by a team member. Notifications do not reveal the contents of a message (need to verify - is this always true?). 

**To manage notifications:**  
TK: different experience for small teams and big teams
On small teams, you can quickly mute and unmute notifications (shhh icon) within chat
On big teams, you can manage desktop and mobile notifications per channel.

## Message history
The entire saved history of messages and files shared within team chats are searchable and readable by everyone on a team (except for exploded messages, of course). Owners determine the length of messages history. Messages can be auto-deleted never, or at set intervals as short as 30 seconds and as long as 365 days. 
{# Question: Is this within teams or within channels? #}
