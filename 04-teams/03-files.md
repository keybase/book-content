## Files for Teams
Files for Teams on Keybase works pretty much the same way it works for individuals. Learn more in [Files](/files).

Teams and subteams can store up to 100 GB of documents, photos, and videos. Anything you store or share with a team on Keybase is automatically end-to-end encrypted. Only the people on a team can access team files. But, everyone on a team can access every file. 

To make files private to specific team members, create a subteam.
