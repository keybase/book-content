## Files for teams
Files for teams on Keybase work the same way they work for individuals. Teams and subteams can store up to 100 GB.

Just like everything else, anything you store or share with a team on Keybase is automatically end-to-end encrypted. This means that only the people—but all the people—on a team can read or access team files. Top secret team files are for the whole team. 

To make files private to specific team members, create a subteam.
