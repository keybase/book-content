## Team features
Teams can be what we call big teams, subteams, or open teams. Each has different features and abilities.

### Big teams 
#### Organize chats in channels.
If you create channels for a chat, your team becomes a big team. It doesn’t matter how many people are in it; even two people can be a big team.

Channels are a way to organize chats. They’re useful for focusing conversations on a specific project or idea but they’re not private. Everyone on a team can search and read all messages and files shared in any and every channel. To share private messages or files, you need to create a subteam.

### Subteams
#### Share private messages and files.
A subteam is a private group created within a team. A subteam can include members of a team as well as people who are not a part of that team.

For example, an organization may want to create a subteam for a hiring committee. The hiring committee subteam could include team members from the organization as well as board members that aren’t a part of the team.

In a subteam, you can share private chats and files within a team. Only members of the subteam can read them. And while teams are public (outsiders may see that they exist but can’t necessarily see who is in them), subteams are stealthy. People who aren’t in them can’t even see that they exist.

Just like any other team, a subteam becomes a big team when you add chat channels. But permissions and roles work a little differently:
* Only team owners and admins can make subteams.
* Subteams do not have owners.
* Subteams may have “implicit admins,” people who are admins of the parent team but not of this subteam.
* Implicit admins do not have access to files and messages shared within a subteam.

### Open teams
#### Build community.
Anyone can join an open team. So, if you’re building a community, you might want to make an open team. You can also let the Keybase community know about it and we may be able to help get the word out.

If you know of an open team you’d like to join, for example `keybasefriends` or `stellar.public`, you can hit `Join a team` to request being added. Since you can’t necessarily see who’s on a team, Keybase pings the admin for you. The admin can accept or ignore your request.
