A chat is automatically created for each team. Chat for teams works pretty much the same as it does for individuals on Keybase but there are a couple nice things to know.
 
For one, team members can reply privately to messages within team chats. Those messages always remain private between those two individuals. Team owners or admins can never access private chats. 
 
You can also create private group chats within a team by making a [subteam](link to subteam section).
 
Otherwise, team chats have access to all the “special features” as other chats: files, GIFS, location sharing, coin flips, and exploding messages.

## Channels
Channels can be used to organize team chats. If you add a channel to a team chat, your team becomes a “big team” and the chat moves to the lower part of your inbox. 
 
Everyone on a team, except readers, can create channels. And — we’re mentioning this again because it’s important — everyone on a team can read messages and files shared in any team channel. (To create chats or share files that are private to specific team members, you need to [make a subteam](link to subteam section).) 
 
If you delete a chat channel, all messages will be lost and gone forever.
 
## Notifications
You can manage the chat notifications you do or don’t want to receive for every chat or channel. Notifications can be sent to your desktop or mobile device. When chat notifications are sent, they only share that a message was posted by a team member. Notifications do not reveal the contents of a message. 
 
## Message history
The entire saved history of messages and files shared within team chats are searchable and readable by everyone on a team (except for exploded messages, of course). Owners determine the length of messages history. Messages can be auto-deleted never, or at set intervals as short as 30 seconds and as long as 365 days.
