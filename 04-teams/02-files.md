# Files
Team files work the same way they work everywhere else on Keybase. Keybase lets you store and share files securely, confidentially, and quickly. Teams and subteams can store up to 100 GB.

Anything you upload to Keybase is automatically [end-to-end encrypted](link to info about encryption). This means that only the people on your team or subteam can read or access your files.

You can upload and share files with a team through the Keybase app, Finder (on a Mac), or TK (on Windows).

TK: something about files for teams vs. subteams (need to better understand subteam permissions as noted in that section)
