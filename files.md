# Files

## What it is
Store and share files securely, confidentially, and quickly. Anything you upload to Keybase is end-to-end encrypted. No one else can read or access your documents (not even Keybase), unless you choose to share them. 

To access files on Keybase, you must have a Keybase account. Yes, this means if you share a file with someone who doesn’t have a Keybase account, they have to create one. But, this is an important security measure. This ensures that your files are only shared with the people you intend to share them with. It also guarantees to the person you’re sharing with that the files came from you. [There’s no opportunity for phishing scams or clicking on bad links].

There are three types of files with different privacy features: public, private, and team. 

### Public files 
Anyone can access your public files (they don’t have to be on Keybase). 

[Use cases for public files besides website?] 

You can also turn your public files into a simple, static website. [Learn more about building a website](link to Pages content).

### Private files
Only you and the people you choose to share with can access your private files. 

[Automatic creation of files to share with others on Keybase.]

### Team files
Everyone on a team can access team files. 
No public team files.

## QUESTIONS

Do we need to specify what kinds of files you can save/share?
How much storage do you have (as an individual and as a team)? 10GB for free? More for paid accounts TBD?

You can only share files with people who have Keybase accounts. This ensures that your files are only shared with the people you intended to share them with.
