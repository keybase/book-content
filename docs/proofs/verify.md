## Proof Verification Script

This is a python3 script intended to help you build an integration with Keybase. The idea is,
if you've built a complete integration on your side, and lightly edited this script for your
specific application, it should pass all the way through.

It takes the path to a [config file](/docs/proof_integration_guide#1-config), and attempts
to make all of the HTTP requests against the site listed in the config. Even if you don't run it, reading
the code might help explain how the back and forth works.

To get started,
1. copy this into a file in a python3 environment,
1. make sure the [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) and
[`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) and [`lxml`](https://lxml.de/) modules are available,
1. update the [example config](/docs/proof_integration_guide#1-config) for your site
1. run it in your terminal like this: `python verify.py ./config.json`

```python
import os
import json
from lxml import html
import requests
import sys

print("Welcome to the Keybase verification script. The point of this script "
"is to help you see what an end-to-end working integration flow looks "
"like. It is our hope that this will help you have something to build "
"against. For more info, check out our docs: "
"http://keybase.io/docs/proof_integration_guide\n")
