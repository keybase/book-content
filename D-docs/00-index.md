# Docs

**[Command Line](/docs/cli) (CLI)**  
Keybase is more than a website. If you’re comfortable working in a terminal (and also if you’re not), you should download the keybase app. You can do so much with it: sign, verify, encrypt, generate messages, sign code, move keys around, etc., all using GPG for the crypto.

**[Trust, Following, Signature Chains, & Our Public Keys](/docs/server)**  
Every account on Keybase has a public history. "Sigchains" let Keybase clients reconstruct the present without trusting Keybase's servers. And when you "follow" someone on Keybase, you sign a snapshot of your view of the claims in their sigchain.

**[Teams](/docs/teams)**  
Design, implementation and specification of Teams.

**[Chat](/docs/chat)**  
Information about Keybase's encrypted chat product.

**[The Keybase Filesystem](/docs/crypto/kbfs)**  
Our cloud-backed file system is live for all.

**[Stellar Wallet](/docs/server/stellar)**  
A description of Keybase's Stellar wallet implementation.

**[Git](/git)**  
Description of the design, implementation, and use of Keybase Git.

**[Crypto](/docs/crypto)**  
Documents describing Keybase's use of cryptography.

**[Bot Development](/docs/bots)**  
Information about Keybase bots and building your own.

**[Linux User Guide](/docs/linux)**  
Linux-specific information about installing, using, and customizing Keybase.

**[Lockdown Mode](/docs/lockdown)**  
A description of Lockdown Mode, recommended for users who want extra protection for their Keybase account.
