TL;DR: Adding devices and paper keys to your Keybase account helps make it more secure. No one can compromise your account unless they have access to all of your devices and paper keys.
{# Would be nice to format this differently than other text on this page. #}

When you create your Keybase account, strong cryptography guarantees an association between your account and the device — your phone or computer — that you sign up with.

This association is guaranteed, which means the only way to lose your account is to lose your device. For this reason, a good next step is to add another device or two to your account. You can do this by installing Keybase on your other devices, providing your Keybase username, and then using a QR code to add the new device with the one you signed up with. After doing this, strong cryptography guarantees an association between your account and *all* devices.

## Paper keys
Paper keys work similarly to devices. [Creating one automatically associates the long string of words with your account.] {# Is that true? Can we explain a little how paper keys work? #} 

You should create at least one paper key, which you should write down and store somewhere like a locked drawer at home. We recommend that you do not store a paper key on your computer, which is why we call them paper keys.

As long as you don’t lose access to all of your devices and paper keys at the same time, you can remove any device that you have lost or replaced, and you can add any new device that you might buy in the future.

At this point, you have control over your account in a way that is extremely reliable and trustworthy. Now you’re ready to let people know this account belongs to you.
