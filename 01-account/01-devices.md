## Devices 
TL;DR: You can think of your devices and paper keys as keys to your account. You can only access your account through your devices. Paper keys provide backup access to your account in case you lose your devices.

Tip: Add multiple devices and paper keys to your account to ensure its security.

When you create your Keybase account, Keybase creates a key pair for your account and the device—your phone or computer—that you sign up with. 

The public key is uploaded to Keybase’s servers and is publicly available. The private key lives only on your device. This means that no one else can access your account—or anything shared through it—without having your device (not even Keybase).

You can and should add more devices and paper keys to your account so you don’t lose access to it if you lose a device. A paper key is a long string of randomly generated words that’s linked to your account the same way a device is.

When you add a new device or paper key, your existing device vouches for the new one. All your devices and paper keys are cryptographically linked. And each additional device or paper key you add to your account also gets a key pair.  

So, no one can compromise your account without having all of your devices and paper keys. This guarantees that only you have access to your account. 

### Adding devices and paper keys
Install Keybase on your other devices so that you don’t lose access to your account if you lose access to a device. 

#### Device names are public and can’t be changed.
When you add a device, you’ll have to name it. Device names are visible to everyone on the internet and can’t be changed. Choose carefully. 

Like your username, devices names are part of a public record that helps secure your account and confirm that you are who you say you are. Changing device names has the potential to undo this.

#### To install Keybase on additional devices, you need:
*  your Keybase username
*  the device you signed up with (you’ll use a QR code to vouch for the new device)
*  a name for the new device

### Revoke lost or old devices
If you lose or replace a device, you should revoke it. Revoking removes the device from your account. 

Revoking lost or old devices helps ensure that only you can access your account. Your account cannot be accessed through revoked devices. 

Revoked devices still publicly appear on your account but are marked as revoked. 

### Add paper keys 
Add paper keys so that you can access your account even if (worst-case scenario) you lose all of your devices.

When you create a paper key, write it down on—you guessed it—paper. It’ll be too long to memorize. We recommend storing paper keys somewhere like a locked drawer at home.
