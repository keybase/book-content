## Make your account more secure
TL;DR: Adding devices and paper keys to your Keybase account helps make it more secure. No one can compromise your account unless they have access to all of your devices and paper keys.
{# Would be nice to format this differently than other text on this page. #}

VIP info/tip: Add multiple devices and paper keys to your account to ensure its security.

When you create your Keybase account, strong cryptography guarantees an association between your account and the device — your phone or computer — that you sign up with.

This association guarantees that you can only access your account through your device. On the flipside, if you lose your device, you lose access to your account. For this reason, a good next step is to add another device or two to your account. You can do this by installing Keybase on your other devices, providing your Keybase username, and then using a QR code to add the new device with the one you signed up with. After doing this, strong cryptography guarantees an association between your account and all of your devices.

If you lose or replace a device, you can and should remove it.  You can also add any new device that you might buy in the future. So long as you don’t lose all of your devices at the same time, you can always access your Keybase account.

### Paper keys help, too
But say you do lose all of your devices at once. If you’ve created a paper key, you can still access your Keybase account and remove all of those devices.

Paper keys work similarly to devices. [Creating one automatically associates the long string of words with your account.] {# Is that true? Can we explain a little how paper keys work? #} 

You should create at least one paper key. We recommend that you write it down (it’ll be too long to memorize) and store it somewhere like a locked drawer at home. They’re called paper keys because it’s better not to store them on your computer.

{# illo update: minor but can we edit the paper key to show an actual string of words written so it looks more like an actual paper key? #}

With a few devices and paper keys, you have control over your account in a way that is extremely reliable and trustworthy. Now you’re ready to let people know this account belongs to you with proofs.
