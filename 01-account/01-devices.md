## Devices 
Tip: Add multiple devices and paper keys to your account to ensure its security.

When you create your Keybase account, Keybase creates a key pair for your account and the device—your phone or computer—that you sign up with. 

The public key is uploaded to Keybase’s servers and is publicly available. The private key lives only on your device. This means that no one else can access your account—or anything shared through it—without having your device (not even Keybase).

You can and should add more devices and paper keys to your account so you don't lose access to it if you lose a device.
When you add additional devices or paper keys to your account, each one also gets a key pair.  

So, no one can compromise your account without having all of your devices and paper keys. This guarantees that only you have access to your account. 

### Add devices 
Install Keybase on your other devices so that you won’t lose access to your account if you lose access to a device.

**To install Keybase on additional devices, you need:**
*  your Keybase username
*  the device you signed up with (you’ll use a QR code to add the new device)
*  a name for the new device

Device names are public and can’t be changed. Choose carefully.

### Revoke lost or old devices
If you lose or replace a device, you should revoke it. Revoking removes the device from your account. 

Revoking lost or old devices helps ensure that only you can access your account. Your account cannot be accessed through revoked devices. 

But, revoked devices still publicly appear on your account. 

### Add paper keys 
Add paper keys so that you can access your account even if (worst-case scenario) you lose all of your devices.

{# illo update: minor but can we edit the paper key to show an actual string of words written so it looks more like an actual paper key? #}

A paper key is essentially a long string of words that’s linked to your account just like a device is.

When you create a paper key, write it down on—you guessed it—paper. It’ll be too long to memorize. We recommend storing paper keys somewhere like a locked drawer at home.
