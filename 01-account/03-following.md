## Help keep accounts trustworthy

TL;DR: Following helps confirm that people are who they say they are on Keybase. But it doesn’t neccessarily indicate a relationship. More importantly, it helps provide reassurance that accounts are trustworthy and haven’t been compromised.

You can follow people on Keybase and they can follow you. But it’s not the same as following someone on Twitter or Instagram for a couple reasons. Following on Keybase doesn’t necessarily imply any sort of relationship or exchange. You can and should follow people you know. But following helps keep accounts secure and trustworthy even if you don’t know someone you follow or someone who follows you. We’ll use an example to help explain. 

Let’s say you follow Mary Poppins on Keybase. You probably don’t know her and she probably doesn’t know you (if that’s not true, lucky you). By following her, you’re basically documenting who she says she is at that point in time, based on all of her proofs and devices. This documentation is a time-stamped public record [that is/can be] checked by anyone else who follows her. It’s also checked by your computer or device if and when you share messages or files with Mary. And if anything about her account changes, you — and everyone else who has followed her and interacts with her — will be notified before you share a message or file with her.

### More followers equals more security 

If you get a notification, you can and should check out Mary’s account and see if anything looks off. The change could be legitimate: adding a new Twitter account or revoking a retired computer. But if you have any doubts, you should reach out to Mary through another channel to find out if she made the change or if her account was compromised. This helps gives both you and Mary more confidence about the safety and trustworthiness of her account.

But you might *not* reach out to Mary if her account changes. You might not interact with her. So, you might not get a notification. Or you just might not know her well enough to reach out through another channel. This is where safety in numbers kicks in. The more followers Mary Poppins has, the more likely that *someone* will attempt to interact with her on Keybase, be notified about a change, and reach out to her over other channels. {# If relevant add something about public database of records all confirming that Mary is who she says she is #}

### Follow sooner rather than later
TK: The older an account, the older its documentation via following, the more secure is.

{#  Imagine that Twitter account had numbers next to it like “connected since 2017” and “verified by 3,000” computers. The older a proof, the better. A fresh Keybase account is slightly less good than an older Keybase account.

Whoever’s had control over this Twitter account for an entire year has control over this account. Would require a public long-term compromise for someone to 

Even if you don’t have any social media proofs, following helps guarantee that your key is still secure. 
Techincally speaking, two different people are announcing that this key is this key, and both can be confirmed.

Keybase’s evil server could give a different answer
By choosing to follow them, you’re publicly announcing what information you got from keybase on who this person is. Because multiple people are announcing it, it has to be the same, it has to be secure. 

How do you know when you asked if it’s Max, that you’re given the correct Max. Everyone is signing public statements about who Max is and it’s all going back to a larger data system. #}
 
### Older drafts 

So, you can be confident that if someone’s account has been compromised and can’t be trusted, you’ll know it. 

The more followers Mary Poppins has, the more public documentation there is that she is who she says she is. 
This makes it increasingly hard for someone to compromise her account. 

 If you want, you can look at all of her info to see if she looks like who she says she is. But you might not really be able to tell — and more importantly, you don’t need to be able to. Keybase and your computer or device will also check out all of her info. And, when Because if one of her devices changes You’re also telling your account that it’s safe to interact with Mary Poppins’s account — it appears trustworthy to you. You might know her personally (lucky you) or recognize a proof or two she’s added. Your computer or device will also check that all of Mary Poppins’s proofs are provable. (This is a very simplified version of what actually happens. You can read more details in [the docs](https://keybase.io/docs/server_security/following).)

{# illo: a server displays Mary Poppins’s proofs (website, twitter, git), a computer and a person are both looking at/confirming the proofs that Mary Poppins’s proofs = Mary Poppins #}
 
Then — and this is the more important part — if one of Mary Poppins’s proofs or devices changes, you (and everyone else who follows her) will be notified before you share a message or file with her. 

It’s best to follow someone (or even someone you’d like to know) now rather than later. when you want or need to interact with them. Because the longer you follow them, the more confident you can be that their account hasn’t been compromised. 


Over time, this guarantees to your friends that your Keybase account is you, and better, to future friends that your Keybase account is you.

### Questions, Assumptions, and Notes

[Existing docs](https://keybase.io/docs/server_security/following)

A person is a timeline of events.

* “This device (phone/computer/tablet) is me.”
* “I exist!”
* “This Twitter account is me.”
* “This device is no longer me, because I lost it.”

Each statement references the last one, which prevents Keybase from leaving any out maliciously (like the last statement, above).

When you sign a statement of who a user is and post it on the server, you (client) can later verify that, and you’ll know that user’s identity hasn’t been messed with, so you can use that public key. (Either it has been the wrong one the whole time or the right one the whole time. Over time, the likelihood that it’s the right one goes up.)
