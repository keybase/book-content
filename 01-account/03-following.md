## Following
Tip: Follow people on Keybase to help make your account and theirs more trustworthy. 
 
Following helps confirm that people are who they say they are on Keybase. But it doesn’t necessarily indicate a relationship. More importantly, following helps provide reassurance that accounts are trustworthy and secure.

### Follow people 
You can and definitely should follow people you know and interact with on Keybase. But following helps keep accounts secure and trustworthy even if you don’t know someone you follow or someone who follows you. 

For example, let’s say you follow Mary Poppins on Keybase. You probably don’t know her and she probably doesn’t know you (if that’s not true, lucky you). By following her, you’re essentially documenting her Keybase account, including all her proofs and devices. This documentation is a time-stamped public record that can be checked by anyone else on Keybase. It’s also automatically checked by your computer or device every time you share messages or files with Ms. Poppins. And if anything about her account changes, you—and everyone else who follows her—will be notified when you attempt to interact with her on Keybase again. 

{# insert illo of people waving illustrations of mary poppins, all of which look the same, except for one that looks different  (e.g. she's wearing sunglasses and a different hat). That illo has a red circle with a slash across it or a red flag waving next to it #}

#### More followers provide more security. 
But if you don’t know Ms. Poppins, you might not interact with her and get notified that her account has changed. This is where safety in numbers kicks in. 

The more followers Mary Poppins has, the more likely that *someone* will attempt to interact with her on Keybase, be notified about the change, and reach out to her over other channels. Then she can confirm that she made the change or recover her account if it’s been hacked. This helps gives both you and Ms. Poppins more confidence about the safety and trustworthiness of her account. 

And even if no one’s interacting with Ms. Poppins on Keybase, you get some confidence knowing that for every follower she has, a public record of who she is (according to her devices and proofs) has been added to a giant, public Keybase database. 
Someone might be able to fake one or even two of these records so they look the same, but it’d be virtually impossible to fake dozens or thousands. 

#### Older followers provide more security than newer ones.
Along the same lines, the older a follower is, the more security it provides. Remember that following someone creates a time-stamped public record of who they are on Keybase (according to their proofs and devices). So, if you followed Ms. Poppins way back in February 2014, your record helps confirm that her account hasn’t been hacked over the years between now and then. If someone had hacked her account, they’d have to maintain control of her computer, other device(s), and proofs over that whole period of time.

So, as long as someone’s account hasn’t been hacked the day you follow them (which would be kinda wild), you can be pretty confident they are who they say they are on Keybase. Likewise, your own followers help guarantee to your contacts—and better, to future contacts—that your Keybase account is controlled by you.

#### Follow soon and follow often. 
If you keep (ahem) *following* this logic, it’s easy to see that an older Keybase account is more secure and trustworthy than a newer Keybase account. And, older followers are more valuable than new followers. So, if you haven’t already, install the app, set up your account, and start following your contacts.

This is a pretty simplified version of how following works. You can dig into more details in our [docs](https://keybase.io/docs/server_security/following) and on [Github](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/100). (Note: following was previously called tracking.)

### Block unwanted followers
While even followers you don’t know help keep your account trustworthy, you can block them. 

When you block someone, you can remove them from your public list of followers. You won’t see them and their account will not be publicly associated with yours. They also won’t be able to chat with you or add you to a team.

But please note, they will still technically be following you. The public record that was created when they followed you will still exist. And they may know that you blocked them if they attempt to chat with you or add you to a team. You can learn more about blocking in [Chat](/chat).
