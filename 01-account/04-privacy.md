## Manage your privacy  
TL;DR Keybase won’t ever sell or rent your data or content. And by design, Keybase can’t access, sell, transmit, or use any of your chats or files (they’re encrypted!). But accounts on Keybase can’t be totally private. You can block and report people. You can also control who is allowed to add you to Keybase features like chats and teams.


### Keybase’s privacy policy 
You can and should read our whole [privacy policy](https://keybase.io/docs/privacypolicy). It’s not too long but you can also skip around to find the info that’s most important to you. 

The gist is that Keybase won’t sell or rent your data or content for any reason. We’ll never rely on ads for revenue. Instead, we’ll probably eventually charge for special features for larger corporations.

Keybase can’t access, sell, transmit, or use your private messages or files. We

We use a public blockchain to protect our users from misbehaving servers. Because of that, you can’t delete your publicly announced account information and account activity once you post it to your signature chain. You can, however, revoke it. Revoking, in Keybase, means retracting the original statement, indicating that it’s no longer true, or that the information has changed.

Accounts on Keybase are public. You can block and report people. You can even control who can add you to chats and teams. But you can’t make your account totally private. This may seem a little nuts but it’s actually part of what makes Keybase so trustworthy. On Keybase, anyone can find anyone else’s public key and know that it’s absolutely the right one without having to use any other (potentially vulnerable and hackable) channels of communication.

Keeping public keys public makes sure that everyone has access to all the features and functionality on Keybase. It also helps ensure that you get the messages and files that are intended for you.

You can trust that people are who they say they are on Keybase — not just because they say they are, and not just because Keybase says they are, but — because absolutely anyone can double-check and be sure that they are. This is also why you can’t use private Twitter or GitHub account as proofs. If accounts are private, not everyone can verify them, and the system breaks down.

### Blocking and reporting
But, you can control who can interact with you here. You can block and report people on an individual basis. Or, you can limit who can chat with you and add you to a team. Learn more in [Chat](chat/blocking).

If you block someone, you can also remove them from your list of followers so you don’t see them and their account is not publicly associated with yours. But they can still follow you.
