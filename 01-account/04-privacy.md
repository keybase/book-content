## Rough draft: Public keys have to be public
TL;DR Accounts on Keybase can’t be private but you can block people and control who can add you to chats and teams.

Accounts on Keybase are public. You can block people and control who can add you to chats and teams. But you can’t make your account private. This may seem a little nuts but it’s actually part of what makes Keybase so secure. On Keybase, anyone can find anyone else’s public key and know that it’s absolutely the right one without having to use any other (potentially vulnerable and hackable) channels of communication. 

Keeping public keys public makes sure that everyone has access to all the features and functionality on Keybase. It also helps make sure that you get the messages and files that are intended for you.

You can trust that people are who they say they are on Keybase — not just because they say they are, and not just because Keybase says they are, but — because absolutely anyone can double-check and be sure that they are. This is also why you can’t use a private Twitter or GitHub account as proofs. If accounts are private, not everyone can verify them, and the public and private key system breaks down.
