## Accounts are public  
TL;DR Accounts on Keybase can’t be totally private. But you can block and report people. You can also control who is allowed to add you to Keybase features like chats and teams.

Accounts on Keybase are public. You can block and report people and control who can add you to chats and teams. But you can’t make your account private. This may seem a little nuts but it’s actually part of what makes Keybase so secure. On Keybase, anyone can find anyone else’s public key and know that it’s absolutely the right one without having to use any other (potentially vulnerable and hackable) channels of communication.

Keeping public keys public makes sure that everyone has access to all the features and functionality on Keybase. It also helps ensure that you get the messages and files that are intended for you.

You can trust that people are who they say they are on Keybase — not just because they say they are, and not just because Keybase says they are, but — because absolutely anyone can double-check and be sure that they are. This is also why you can’t use a private Twitter or GitHub account as proofs. If accounts are private, not everyone can verify them, and the system starts to break down.

### Blocking and reporting
But, you can still control how you use Keybase and who can interact with you here. You can block and report people on an individual basis. Or, you can limit who can chat with you and add you to a team. Learn more in [Chat](chat/blocking).

Even if you block someone, they can still follow you. You can remove them from your follows so you don’t see them. But they can still see you.

### Privacy policy TK
Keybase won’t sell or rent your data or content for any reason.

By design, Keybase can’t access, sell, transmit, or use your encrypted content.

We use a public blockchain to protect our users from misbehaving servers. Because of that, you can’t delete your publicly announced account information and account activity once you post it to your signature chain. You can, however, revoke it. Revoking, in Keybase, means retracting the original statement, indicating that it’s no longer true, or that the information has changed.
