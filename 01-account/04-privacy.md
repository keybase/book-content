## Manage your privacy  
By design, Keybase can’t access or use any of your messages or files (because they’re end-to-end encrypted).  

But accounts on Keybase can’t be totally private. And public info can’t be totally deleted. You can revoke info to indicate that it’s changed. You can block and report people. You can also control who is allowed to add you to Keybase features like chats and teams.

### Your data is your data 
You can and should read our whole [privacy policy](https://keybase.io/docs/privacypolicy). It’s not too long and you can skip around to find the info that’s most important to you. 

The gist is that Keybase won’t sell or rent your data or content for any reason. We can’t even access it. And, we’ll never rely on ads for revenue. Eventually, we may charge for special features for larger corporations. (But individual and existing accounts will always be free.)

### Public info can’t be deleted 
Keybase uses a public blockchain to protect you from bad actors. Because of this, you can’t delete any account information that’s public (your username, device names, and proofs, for example). You can revoke public info. Revoking, in Keybase, means retracting the original information, indicating that it’s no longer true, or has otherwise changed.

Accounts on Keybase are public. You can block and report people. You can even control who can add you to chats and teams. But you can’t make your account totally private. This may seem a little nuts but it’s actually part of what makes Keybase so trustworthy. On Keybase, anyone can find anyone else’s public key and know that it’s absolutely the right one without having to use any other (potentially vulnerable and hackable) channels of communication.

Keeping public keys public makes sure that everyone has access to all the features and functionality on Keybase. It also helps ensure that you get the messages and files that are intended for you.

You can trust that people are who they say they are on Keybase — not just because they say they are, and not just because Keybase says they are, but — because absolutely anyone can double-check and be sure that they are. This is also why you can’t use private Twitter or GitHub account as proofs. If accounts are private, not everyone can verify them, and the system breaks down.

### Blocking and reporting
But, you can control who can interact with you here. You can block and report people on an individual basis. Or, you can limit who can chat with you and add you to a team. Learn more in [Chat](chat/blocking).

If you block someone, you can also remove them from your list of followers so you don’t see them and their account is not publicly associated with yours. But they can still follow you.
