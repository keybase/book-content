## Protect your identity
Multiple layers of encryption make Keybase accounts — and by extension, your identity — extremely secure and trustworthy. 

Installing the app on your computer or device provides the first layer; adding more devices, paper keys, and proofs, and following provide additional layers of security.

The more of these steps you take, the more sure you can be that your account is unhackable. And the more sure others can be that you are you on Keybase.

[Devices](account/devices)  
Adding devices and paper keys to your Keybase account helps make it more secure. No one can compromise your account unless they have access to all of your devices and paper keys. [Learn more](account/devices).

[Proofs](account/proofs)  
Proofs publicly and provably link your Keybase account to your other online accounts so people can see that you are really you.     [Learn how](account/proofs).

[Following](accounts/following)  
Following helps confirm that people are who they say they are on Keybase. But it doesn’t necessarily indicate a relationship. [Learn more](accounts/following).

[Privacy](accounts/privacy)  
Keybase accounts can’t be totally private. But you can control who is allowed to add you to things like chats and teams. You can also block and report people. [Learn more](accounts/privacy).
