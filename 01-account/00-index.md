## Your Keybase Account
TL;DR Public-key encryption makes your Keybase account trustworthy and secure. Installing Keybase on your computer or device, adding more devices and paper keys, adding proofs, and following all make your Keybase account more secure. 

Your Keybase account is trustworthy and secure because your contacts can be sure that it belongs to you and that only you can access it. 

Lots of apps only require a username and password to establish an account. Your username theoretically lets others know that an account belongs to you. And your password theoretically allows only you to access it. 

But with just a username and password, accounts can be hacked, phished, and otherwise compromised. They’re not totally trustworthy and secure. In best-case scenarios, you can use two-factor authentication for more security but it’s still not perfect. Keybase uses encryption instead.

Your contacts can trust your Keybase account because it’s cryptographically linked to your [devices](account/devices). Keybase creates a key pair between your account and any device you add to it. As long as only you have access to your devices, only you have access to your account.

Your identity is confirmed with [proofs](account/proofs). [Following](account/following) provides a public record that also confirms that you are who you say you are. These are public actions. And, as the name “proof” implies, these actions are also provable. Your contacts don’t have to trust that you’re you just because you say you are; they can see for themselves.

If anything changes to your devices or proofs—indicating that your account has possibly been hacked—your contacts are notified before they share anything with you.
