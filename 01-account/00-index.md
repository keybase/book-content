## Your Keybase account
Multiple layers of encryption make Keybase accounts—and by extension, your identity—extremely secure and trustworthy.

Installing the app on your computer or device provides the first layer; adding more devices, adding proofs, and following provide additional layers of security.

The more of these steps you take, the more secure your account becomes. And the more sure others can be that you are you on Keybase.

[Devices](account/devices)  
Adding devices and paper keys to your Keybase account helps make it more secure. No one can compromise your account unless they have access to all of your devices and paper keys. [Learn more](account/devices).

[Proofs](account/proofs)  
Proofs link your Keybase account to your other online accounts so people can see that you are really you. [Learn how](account/proofs).

[Following](accounts/following)  
Following helps confirm that people are who they say they are on Keybase. But it doesn’t necessarily indicate a relationship. [Learn more](accounts/following).
