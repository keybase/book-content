## Your Keybase Account
Public-key encryption makes your Keybase account secure and trustworthy. 

Your contacts can be sure that you are you because your account is linked to your [devices](account/devices). Your identity is further confirmed with [proofs](account/proofs). And [following](account/following) provides a public record that also confirms that you are who you say you are. 

If anything changes, indicating that your account has possibly been hacked, your contacts are notified before they share anything with you.

TL;DR Installing Keybase on your computer or device, adding more devices and paper keys, adding proofs, and following all make your Keybase account more secure.
