## Proofs help confirm who you are 
The best way to let others know that your Keybase account belongs to you is to tell them in person. The next best way is through proofs.

Proofs link your Keybase account to your other online accounts so people can see that you are really you. Proofs are public—Keybase checks them, and so can you. The idea is that when you prove your Keybase identity through your other social proofs, you really are who you say you are, unless your entire online identity has been compromised.

Tip: Add as many proofs as you can to provide the most assurance that you are you on Keybase.

### Add proofs
Keybase supports proofs for your personal website and your Twitter, GitHub, Reddit, and Hacker News accounts. {# TODO: Consider showing what a proof looks like. #}

{# update this illo to 1: include a screenshot of Mary Poppins’s tweet to help indicate that the tweet itself must be public/visible/not deleted and 2: indicate that the tweet confirms the proof with something like a checkmark #}

For example, if you use your Twitter account as a proof, Keybase will give you a specific phrase to tweet that includes your Keybase username. For the proof to work, you must tweet the phrase exactly as Keybase gives it to you, your account must be public, and you can’t delete the tweet.

Keybase regularly scans for proofs, and if someone you follow changes or deletes one, we’ll warn you.

Proofs must remain public to allow Keybase and anyone else to verify them. That way, you’re free to trust Keybase’s proof-checking, or not.

Keybase’s method of identity verification through proofs is what sets us apart from all other apps. Where else can you go to be sure that @malgorithms on Twitter, Reddit, GitHub and Hacker News is also ccoyne77 on Facebook and the owner of chriscoyne.com?  And send him a message or file that only he can read? Nowhere but Keybase.

We’ve built some useful features on top of our identity verification—encrypted Chat, Files, and Git—but the sky’s the limit.  Anyone can use Keybase to build their own tools that require verifying someone’s identity, and we hope you do.
