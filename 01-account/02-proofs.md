## Tell people who you are on Keybase

TL;DR: Proofs publicly and provably link your Keybase account to your other online accounts so people can see that you are really you.

Once you’ve added a device (or two) and a paper key (or two), your ownership of your account is extremely reliable. In fact, it’s much more reliable than any account protected with only a password. Well done.

Now you’re ready to let others know your Keybase account belongs to you. The best way to do this is to tell them in person, especially people you know. But there are probably people you primarily interact with online or don’t know yet, and you want them to know your account is really yours, too.

Proofs are a good way to provide this assurance. In spirit, proofs are a simple way to let people know that the person who owns a particular Keybase account can prove they also own other online accounts, or even websites, and these proofs are public and provable.

### Proofs are public
VIP info/tip: When you add a proof, make sure it’s public and don’t delete it.

You can add proofs for your Twitter, GitHub, Reddit, or HackerNews accounts, or your personal website. Twitter is one of the most popular social proofs. 

To prove your link to your Twitter account, you’ll be asked to tweet something like this:

```
Verifying myself: I am marypoppins on Keybase.io. qqwVuwQvrQjnXG-2MUb7pdkhZzBwyXWujXUz / https://keybase.io/marypoppins/sigs/qqwVuwQvrQjnXG-2MUb7pdkhZzBwyXWujXUz
```

For convenience, Keybase will verify this proof. But importantly, anyone can (you don’t have to trust Keybase). So, your tweet must be public and you can’t delete it.

It’s a good idea to add multiple proofs. More proofs give people more assurance that your Keybase account really belongs to you.

Once you’ve added multiple devices and multiple proofs, you can be sure that only you can access your Keybase account, and other people can be sure your Keybase account really belongs to you.

Your account is extremely trustworthy. It provides the basis of the secure chat, file sharing, and other features that Keybase provides.
