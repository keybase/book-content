## Proofs  
Tip: Add as many proofs as you can to provide the most assurance that you are you on Keybase.

The best way to let others know that your Keybase account belongs to you is to tell them in person. The next best way is through proofs.

Proofs link your Keybase account to your other online accounts. Generally, proofs help people trust that you are really you on Keybase. Some people may already know you as you through your other accounts. But proofs are public so Keybase can (and does) check them, but importantly, anyone can. Publicly proving that you are who you say you are is an important part of what makes Keybase accounts so secure and trustworthy.

If a proof is changed, indicating that your Keybase or other social accounts may have been compromised, Keybase will automatically warn the people you interact with.

### Add proofs
You can add proofs for your personal website and social accounts on Twitter, GitHub, Reddit, and Hacker News. But your social accounts must be public for them to work as proofs.

{# update this illo to 1: include a screenshot of Mary Poppins’s tweet to help indicate that the tweet itself must be public/visible/not deleted and 2: indicate that the tweet confirms the proof with something like a checkmark #}

For example, if you use your Twitter account as a proof, Keybase will give you a specific phrase to tweet that includes your Keybase username. For the proof to work, you must tweet the phrase exactly as Keybase gives it to you. The tweet must be public and you can’t delete it.

Keeping proofs public lets Keybase—and anyone else—check them. Everyone can be sure that you are you.
