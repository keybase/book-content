## Confirm who you are 
TL;DR: Proofs publicly and provably link your Keybase account to your other online accounts so people can see that you are really you.

VIP tip: Add multiple proofs to provide more assurance that you are you.

The best way to let others know that your Keybase account belongs to you is to tell them in person. The next best way is through proofs.  

Proofs let people know that the person who owns a particular Keybase account also owns other online accounts or websites. Proofs are public and provable.

### Add proofs
You can add your Twitter, GitHub, Reddit, or HackerNews accounts, or your personal website as proofs. 

For convenience, Keybase verifies proofs. But importantly, anyone can—you don’t have to trust Keybase. So, proofs must be public and you can’t delete them.

{# update this illo to 1: include a screenshot of Mary Poppins’s tweet to help indicate that the tweet itself must be public/visible/not deleted and 2: indicate that the tweet confirms the proof with something like a checkmark #}

For example, if you want to use your Twitter account as a proof, you’ll tweet a specific phrase that includes your Keybase username. For the proof to work, you must tweet the phrase exactly as it is, your account must be public, and you can’t delete the tweet.

All of that info must be available to allow other people to verify your proof.

Add as many proofs as you can. More proofs give people more assurance that your Keybase account really belongs to you.
