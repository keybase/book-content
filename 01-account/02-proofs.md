Once you’ve signed up for a Keybase account and have added another device (or two) and a paper key (or two), your ownership of your account is extremely reliable. In fact, it’s much more reliable than any account protected with only a password. Well done.

Now you’re ready to let others know your Keybase account belongs to you. The best way to do this is to tell them in person, especially people you know, but there are probably people you primarily interact with online or don’t know yet, and you want them to know your account is really yours, too.

Proofs are a good way to provide this assurance. In spirit, proofs are a simple way to let people know that the person who owns a particular Keybase account can prove they also own other online accounts, or even websites, and these proofs are public and provable.

One of the most popular social proofs to add is Twitter. To prove your Twitter identity, you’ll be asked to tweet something like this:

```
Verifying myself: I am marypoppins on Keybase.io. qqwVuwQvrQjnXG-2MUb7pdkhZzBwyXWujXUz / https://keybase.io/marypoppins/sigs/qqwVuwQvrQjnXG-2MUb7pdkhZzBwyXWujXUz
```

It’s important that this is a public tweet; be sure you don’t delete it. For convenience, Keybase will verify this proof, but importantly, anyone can.

You can add proofs for many different services, including GitHub, and even websites. It’s a good idea to add multiple proofs. This is what gives people more assurance that your Keybase account really belongs to you.

Now that you have added multiple devices and multiple proofs, you can be sure that only you can access your Keybase account, and other people can be sure your Keybase account really belongs to you.

This is an extremely trustworthy account, and it provides the basis of the secure chat, file sharing, and other features that Keybase provides.
