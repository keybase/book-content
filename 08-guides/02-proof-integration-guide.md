{% set section_title = "Proof Integration Guide" %}

The most basic idea behind Keybase is that it‚Äôs a protocol and directory for connecting people‚Äôs identities and keys together. For example, it is
cryptographically proven that Keybase user **[tammy](https://keybase.io/tammy)** is all of these identities:

![](https://keybase.io/images/paramproofs/tammy.png)
(Thanks to tammy for letting us use her happy profile as an example in the app store.)

If you know **[@tammycamp](https://twitter.com/tammycamp)** on Twitter, Keybase can provide you her keys and proof that they are in fact her keys. And, going in the other direction, you can start with something she signed, and know for certain it was signed by Twitter user **@tammycamp**.

Today we are opening up a set of steps that _your app or website_ can follow to get cryptographic connections to Keybase. In other words, your service can join Reddit, Twitter, Github, and Facebook on Keybase profiles. Also, Keybase profiles will appear on the profiles of your service, allowing users to know how to reach each other securely.

This short guide is a walkthrough of the endpoints you‚Äôll need to implement to make it happen. It‚Äôs not much work.

#### Looking for a Mastodon instance?

Mastodon has built-in support for Keybase proofs starting with version 2.8.0. If you don't see the instance you're looking for in the Keybase app, contact *[@mlsteele](https://keybase.io/mlsteele)* or email `miles@keyba.se` to have it added to the list.

## Getting started

As you read this guide, you‚Äôll go through:
  - [Proof creation](#proof-creation); this is when the user signs a statement in Keybase, claiming to be a member of your service
  - [Proof checking](#proof-checking); the proof signature can be requested from your service, and cryptographically checked by anyone 
  - [Linking](#linking-user-profiles); you and Keybase will link to each other, but only upon a successful proof

In this guide, let‚Äôs call your service the Identity Service, though we both know it‚Äôs so much more. Integrating with Keybase as an identity service involves implementing some product features, a couple API endpoints, and then talking to us. You‚Äôll also send us a config file (described below) which we‚Äôll use to finish out the integration.

To help with your integration we have a [Python reference implementation](https://github.com/keybase/django-keybase-proofs) if you prefer to consume the material that way and a [verification script](https://keybase.io/docs/proof_integration_guide/verification_script) for testing things out. We also have a [Clojure reference implementation](https://github.com/keybase/colorbase) using a [Clojure helper library](https://github.com/keybase/clj-keybase-proofs).

Throughout this document our examples are written using [httpie](https://httpie.org/) for simplicity.

## Config

Let‚Äôs start with the config file, which has all the information Keybase needs
to know about the Identity Service.  It presents a high-level view of the
integration. All of the fields are required unless noted as optional, and all
endpoints must be HTTPS.


{# NOTE: python gives the comments better coloring; comments not allowed in JSON #}

### Config Validation

Before sending us the config you should validate that it is correct using the following endpoint. You can pass the config directly in a `config` param or host the config file and pass `config_url`:

```sh
$ http POST "https://keybase.io/_/api/1.0/validate_proof_config.json" config=@config.json
{
    "status": {
        "code": 100,
        "desc": "missing or invalid inputs {\"domain\":\"field is required\"}",
        "fields": {
            "config": "missing or invalid inputs {\"domain\":\"field is required\"}"
        },
        "name": "INPUT_ERROR"
    }
}
...
$ http GET "https://keybase.io/_/api/1.0/validate_proof_config.json" config_url="https://keybase.io/.well-known/example-proof-config.json"
{
    "status": {
        "code": 0,
        "name": "OK"
    }
}
```

To send us the config, you can send us the public URL for your config file or attach it directly in a Keybase chat message to ****[@mlsteele](https://keybase.io/mlsteele)**** or email miles@keyba.se. In our example the file is hosted at https://keybase.io/.well-known/example-proof-config.json.

---

## Protocol

Before getting into the nitty-gritty of the protocol, here is the overall flow of requests between the Keybase clients, Keybase server, and the Identity Service.

### Flow Overview

For this example we‚Äôll use the values in the config file defined above with an example user: `josavesbees` on the BeeActivists service and `joans` on Keybase.

1. Joan clicks on a link like ( [keybase://profile/new-proof/beeactivists.com/josavesbees](keybase://profile/new-proof/mastodon.social/josavesbees) ) in BeeActivitists (or navigates to the new-proof flow manually in Keybase and searches for beeactivists.com) to get into the start of the flow. 
2. Joan is now in Keybase looking at a statement asserting ownership of the `josavesbees` account at BeeActivists. After clicking `Authorize`, the Keybase client creates a proof statement and stores it in `joans`‚Äôs public [signature chain](https://keybase.io/docs/sigchain), and then forwards control to a URL in BeeActivists to finish the assertions.

The above two steps can also be accomplished directly from the Keybase CLI

```sh
$ keybase prove beeactivists.com josavesbees
Please click on the following link to post to BeeActivists:
https://beeactivists.com/new-profile-proof?kb_username=joans&username=josavesbees&token=90b0ef50119e69063d3a96625195a5ea895071debbb50a111ddde2eba9d4ecf40f&kb_ua=darwin:3.0.0
```

3. Joan is now inside beeactivists.com at the link generated by Keybase. They are either already logged in as josavesbees, or must login. Then they are presented their Keybase username and reminded their BeeActivists username. If the 2 usernames are what they wish to connect, they just click ‚ÄúYes, authorize‚Äù to finish the connection.

4. *Before actually saving this data*, BeeActivists makes a request to Keybase to verify that the `sig_hash` is valid for this combination of `kb_username`, `username`, and `token`. If valid, BeeActivists persists the signature (e.g., in a relational database).

5. The signature should now be served in machine readable form via the `check_url` endpoint from the config. It should also be seen in human-readable form (with a link to the Keybase website) via the `profile_url` field.

Now let‚Äôs drill into the back-and-forth communication for each request.

### Proof Creation

This process needs to start from Keybase so we can prepare the proof for the Identity Service to host. To make this experience better for your users, you can direct a user to exactly the right spot to get started in Keybase with a deeplink: e.g. `keybase://profile/new-proof/beeactivists.com/josavesbees`

1. From Keybase, the user creates a proof and clicks a link that opens a web browser into the Identity Service. Inside the link, Keybase embeds the hash of the proof signature and the user‚Äôs Keybase username. The user needs to be logged into the Identity Service at this time, so please redirect to a login form and back if necessary.
1. The user reviews that both their `BeeActivists` username and their Keybase usernames are correct, then authorizes the cryptographic connection.

![](https://keybase.io/images/paramproofs/beeactivist-authorize@2x.jpg)
The user has to authorize the cryptographic connection between the two identities.
      
![](https://keybase.io/images/paramproofs/beeactivist-login@2x.jpg)

If `josavesbees` isn‚Äôt logged in on `beesactivists`, they should be redirected to a login screen.

3. The Identity Service validates the signature with Keybase and saves this data so it can be served during the [Proof Checking](#proof-checking) flow described below.

Keybase creates the link via the `prefill_url` in the config, and here‚Äôs everything you need to know:
1. This proof should be stored forever unless it is updated or deleted by the user.
1. We allow a user of the Identity Service to claim multiple Keybase accounts although a Keybase user may only prove one profile at at time on a given service.
1. The creation endpoint must be accessible via HTTPS on the domain or a subdomain of the Identity Service.
1. The `prefill_url` must have four fields for Keybase to fill in, the Keybase username, the Identity service‚Äôs username, signature hash ( a ~66 character hex string), and a user agent field.  The user agent is used to redirect the client appropriately after successful proof creation but doesn‚Äôt need be stored.  We recommend something simple like `https://beeactivists.com/new-profile-proof?kb_username=%{kb_username}&username=%{username}&token=%{sig_hash}&kb_ua=%{kb_ua}`.

Here‚Äôs an example of some code that might work to create a new proof. Most of this would normally happen in a browser, but we‚Äôll show it in Python for extreme explicitness. This user is `josavesbees` on BeeActivists and `joans` on Keybase.

```python
import requests

# Creating a logged-in session, because it should not be possible to prove
# ownership of an account on Bee Activists without being logged into that
# account.
session = requests.session()
login_url = "https://beeactivists.com/auth/sign_in"
result = session.get(login_url)
data = {
    "user[email]": "josavesbees@email.com",
    "user[password]": "hunter2",
}
resp = session.post(login_url, data=data, headers=dict(referrer=login_url))

# Keybase will make this GET request inside a browser for the user.
# This should put them on a page with a form that's got `joans`
# and `90b0ef50119e69063d3a96625195a5ea895071debbb50a111ddde2eba9d4ecf40f`
# filled into two fields.
prefill_url = "https://beeactivists.com/new-profile-proof?kb_username=joans&username=josavesbees&token=90b0ef50119e69063d3a96625195a5ea895071debbb50a111ddde2eba9d4ecf40f&kb_ua=darwin:3.0.0"
resp = session.get(prefill_url)

# The user in the browser will look at the values prefilled and hit submit.
# The submit endpoint can be different if you'd like, but for now, I'm just
# going to use the same url (POST with data this time instead of GET).
# Note the `kb_ua` parameter is not stored but is echoed back as a redirection
# parameter after successful creation.
data = {
    "kb_username": "joans",
    "token": "90b0ef50119e69063d3a96625195a5ea895071debbb50a111ddde2eba9d4ecf40f",
    "kb_ua": "darwin:3.0.0",
}
resp = session.post("https://beeactivists.com/new-profile-proof", data=data)
```

When validating the new proof, the identity service should call the `sig/proof_valid` endpoint as mentioned.

```
$ http GET https://keybase.io/_/api/1.0/sig/proof_valid.json?domain=beeactivists.com&kb_username=joans&username=josavesbees&sig_hash=90b0ef50119e69063d3a96625195a5ea895071debbb50a111ddde2eba9d4ecf40f
{ "proof_valid" : true }
```

If a user tries to post a proof and the Keybase API responds that `proof_valid=false`, the Identity Service should reject this proof. When calling `keybase.io/_/api/1.0/sig/proof_valid.json?...` Keybase verifies the signature preventing:
1. A user from posting an invalid signature
1. A valid signature for a different service
1. A user from claiming the wrong account on either service


#### Creation Redirect

If the proof is valid, once the data is persisted by the Identity Service, the user should be redirected back to Keybase via the following URL:

```
https://keybase.io/_/proof_creation_success?domain=beeactivists.com&kb_username=joans&username=josavesbees&sig_hash=90b0ef50119e69063d3a96625195a5ea895071debbb50a111ddde2eba9d4ecf40f&kb_ua=darwin:3.0.0`
```

Keybase will then redirect the user back into the app or the appropriate web page.

---

### Proof Checking

Keybase needs to check the proof periodically on the Identity Service to ensure that the user has not removed it. Similarly, the Identity Service may want to know if the user has revoked the proof on Keybase. For this reason, there is a protocol for both services to request the current state from one another. Keybase will always check the Identity Services‚Äô proofs, but it is optional for Identity Services to check Keybase‚Äôs proofs. 

#### Keybase Will Regularly Check Proofs On The Identity Service

The proof-checking endpoint on the Identity Service should return JSON that includes a list of the Keybase usernames (and signature hashes) that the Identity Service user has claimed. This is exactly the same information that was created above.

The `check_url` in the config can be any HTTPS endpoint on the Identity Service domain with a spot to fill in the Identity Service username. It‚Äôll be easier if this is a new endpoint, but we‚Äôll look at examples of both cases.

##### A New Endpoint Just for Keybase Proof Checking (the Happy Path)

Here‚Äôs a check for `josavesbees` of Bee Activists, who has two verified Keybase accounts.

The `check_url` in the config:

```http
https://api.beeactivists.com/keybase-proofs.json?username=%{username}
```

The response from the endpoint:

```sh
$ http GET https://api.beeactivists.com/keybase-proofs.json?username=josavesbees
{
  "signatures": [
    {
      "kb_username": "joans",
      "sig_hash": "90b0ef50119e69063d3a96625195a5ea895071debbb50a111ddde2eba9d4ecf40f"
    },
    {
      "kb_username": "joans_school",
      "sig_hash": "a2934c38dd76f01934e29d533b72ab787688f5392902225788c44af0e95c1c370f"
    }
  ]
}
```

And the `check_path`:

```
["signatures"]
```

---

##### An Existing Endpoint With Keybase Proofs Added Somewhere (Still Happy, Just a Little More Work)

Here‚Äôs the same check with a shared endpoint.

The `check_url` in the config:

```http
https://beeactivists.com/api/u/%{username}/attestations.json
```

The response from the endpoint:

```sh
$ http GET https://beeactivists.com/api/u/josavesbees/attestations.json
{
  "attestations": [
    {
      "verified": {
        "something": "that keybase doesnt care about"
      }
    },
    {
      "verified": {
        "another thing": "that keybase doesnt care about"
      }
    },
    {
      "verified": {
        "kb123": [
          {
            "kb_username": "joans",
            "sig_hash": "90b0ef50119e69063d3a96625195a5ea895071debbb50a111ddde2eba9d4ecf40f"
          },
          {
            "kb_username": "joans_school",
            "sig_hash": "a2934c38dd76f01934e29d533b72ab787688f5392902225788c44af0e95c1c370f"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "verified": {
        "final thing": "that keybase doesnt care about"
      }
    }
  ],
  "avatar": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/keybase_processed_uploads/0e67d0f8c3b09def87fda7d6b504a505_360_360.jpg"
}
```

And the `check_path`:

```
["attestations", 2, "verified", "kb123"]
```

##### Details

The endpoint and JSON path shouldn‚Äôt change without notice, because there might be older Keybase clients in the wild checking for it. It will also be used by Keybase to determine whether or not the Identity Service is up, and whether or not the Keybase user exists in the Identity Service. If the endpoint must be changed, you can update your config and contact us to propagate the change.

Keybase clients and servers will always send the header `Accept: application/json`.

If a username does not exist, then the endpoint must return a 404 status code. This endpoint is used during the proof creation process (2.2) to determine whether the user exists.

```sh
$ http GET https://api.beeactivists.com/keybase-proofs.json?username=doesntexist
-> status 404
```

If a user exists but has no Keybase proof claims, then the `check_url` endpoint must return a 200 response with an empty list.

```sh
$ http GET https://api.beeactivists.com/keybase-proofs.json?username=grinch
{
  "signatures": [],
  "avatar": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/keybase_processed_uploads/0e67d0f8c3b09def87fda7d6b504a505_360_360.jpg"
}
```

Keybase clients check all of the proofs of all of the users they interact with at most once-per-day.  So you can expect load correlated with the number of proofs and related activity on Keybase.

##### Avatars

The `check_proof` endpoint may return the user‚Äôs avatar. The avatar is shown to the user while they enter a username in the app. Responding with an avatar is encouraged, but optional.

```sh
$ http GET https://api.beeactivists.com/keybase-proofs.json?username=josavesbees
{
  "signatures": [],
  "avatar": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/keybase_processed_uploads/0e67d0f8c3b09def87fda7d6b504a505_360_360.jpg"
}
```

And the `avatar_path`:

```
["avatar"]
```

#### The Identity Service May Optionally Check Proofs On Keybase After Creation

We have exposed an endpoint that looks very similar to the `proof_valid` endpoint above, except this one additionally verifies that the proof is live on the Identity Service. This should only be called after the proof has been created successfully on the Identity Service and is served at the proof checking endpoint.

```
$ http GET https://keybase.io/_/api/1.0/sig/proof_live.json?domain=beeactivists.com&kb_username=joans&username=josavesbees&sig_hash=90b0ef50119e69063d3a96625195a5ea895071debbb50a111ddde2eba9d4ecf40f
{ "proof_live" : true, "proof_valid" : true }
```

When calling `keybase.io/_/api/1.0/sig/proof_live.json?...` Keybase checks that the signature for this user is valid on Keybase and accessible on BeeActivists. More info about accessibility and linking at [linking user profile section](#linking-user-profiles).

BeeActivists, to create a better experience for its users, may want to persist and periodically update 2 fields per proof that track whether or not Keybase thinks the proof is valid and live. This would enable BeeActivists to, for example, hide the link on the user profile page to Keybase if it‚Äôs not currently live.

In particular, for the best user experience, the Identity Service should keep the proof hidden on the user‚Äôs profile page until it is live.

When a user creates a proof, after the user is redirected to the `proof_creation_success` endpoint on Keybase, the Identity Service can poll for the liveness of the proof asynchronously and update a record in the database when the check succeeds, causing the proof to be shown on the user‚Äôs profile page.

Additionally, whenever a user visits their own profile after the fact, the Identity Service can check the liveness of the user‚Äôs Keybase proofs and update the database records, so the user sees the latest data.

If the Identity Service does not want to run these checks, a [proof badge](#linking-user-profiles) is recommended so users on the Identity Service can see when a proof is no longer live.

### Proof Deletion

A proof can be deleted in two ways:

1. The user deletes the proof from Identity Service. This causes the periodic check by Keybase clients and server to fail, and the proof will show as failing on that user‚Äôs Keybase profile. There will also be indications of the failure to other users tracking them. It is not required, but helpful if the Identity Service makes a request to the `proof_live` endpoint after deleting the proof from the database so Keybase immediately knows that the proof is deleted.
1. The user revokes a signature through Keybase (rendering it invalid). Keybase clients will ignore the revoked proof and, if the Identity Service is periodically checking proof liveness on Keybase, it will also be able to hide them. If the Identity Service is [displaying badges](#linking-user-profiles), then the proof will be marked as ‚ÄúRevoked.‚Äù

## Linking User Profiles

In addition to the proof creation and checking flows, one other step is part of the integration: a link on the Identity Service to the corresponding verified Keybase profile. Keybase will also link to the user‚Äôs profile on the Identity Service on their Keybase profile.

The URL format to link to Keybase profiles via a specific signature is: `https://keybase.io/%{kb_username}/sigs/%{sig_hash}`.

For our running example this could look like:

```html
<a href="https://keybase.io/joans/sigs/90b0ef50119e69063d3a96625195a5ea895071debbb50a111ddde2eba9d4ecf40f">
    @joans on keybase
</a>
```

Additionally, you can optionally include a badge: a small SVG image provided by the Keybase server that displays the proof‚Äôs status. With the badge, if the user deletes the proof on Keybase but not on the the Identity Service, visitors can tell that the proof is no longer valid at a glance.

The endpoint for a proof‚Äôs badge is: `https://keybase.io/%{kb_username}/proof_badge/%{sig_hash}?domain=beeactivists.com&username=josavesbees`. In addition to the plaintext link above, you can add:

```html
<a href="https://keybase.io/joans/sigs/90b0ef50119e69063d3a96625195a5ea895071debbb50a111ddde2eba9d4ecf40f">
    <img alt="Keybase proof status" src="https://keybase.io/joans/proof_badge/90b0ef50119e69063d3a96625195a5ea895071debbb50a111ddde2eba9d4ecf40f?domain=beeactivists.com&username=josavesbees">
</a>
```
A successful proof has a badge like this:

{# TODO: external SVG
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="110" height="20"><title>Keybase proof status: ok</title><linearGradient id="b" x2="0" y2="100%"><stop offset="0" stop-color="#bbb" stop-opacity=".1"/><stop offset="1" stop-opacity=".1"/></linearGradient><clipPath id="a"><rect width="110" height="20" rx="3" fill="#fff"/></clipPath><g clip-path="url(#a)"><path fill="#555" d="M0 0h55v20H0z"/><path fill="#97CA00" d="M55 0h55v20H55z"/><path fill="url(#b)" d="M0 0h110v20H0z"/></g><g fill="#fff" text-anchor="middle" font-family="DejaVu Sans,Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif" font-size="110"> <text x="285" y="150" fill="#010101" fill-opacity=".3" transform="scale(.1)" textLength="450">keybase</text><text x="285" y="140" transform="scale(.1)" textLength="450">keybase</text><text x="815" y="150" fill="#010101" fill-opacity=".3" transform="scale(.1)" textLength="450">proof ok</text><text x="815" y="140" transform="scale(.1)" textLength="450">proof ok</text></g> </svg>
#}

If you don‚Äôt want to use the badge or you want to hide failing proofs instead of showing a failing badge, you can use the `sig/proof_live` endpoint detailed in the [Proof Checking](#proof-checking) section.

## Steps to Rollout

1. Implement the [proof-creation flow](#proof-creation)
1. Implement the [proof-checking flow](#proof-checking)
1. [Add a link](#linking-user-profiles) on your users‚Äô profile screens if they‚Äôve claimed a Keybase account, and if Keybase agrees that the signature is valid.

## Proof Verification Script

This is a Python 3 script intended to help you build an integration with Keybase. The idea is, if you've built a complete integration on your side, and lightly edited this script for your specific application, it should pass all the way through.

It takes the path to a [config file](#config), and attempts to make all of the HTTP requests against the site listed in the config. Even if you don't run it, reading the code might help explain how the back and forth works.

To get started,
1. copy this into a file in a Python 3 environment,
1. make sure the [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) and [`lxml`](https://lxml.de/) modules are available,
1. update the [example config](/docs/proof_integration_guide#1-config) for your site
1. run it in your terminal like this: `python verify.py ./config.json`

```python
import os
import json
from lxml import html
import requests
import sys

print("Welcome to the Keybase verification script. The point of this script "
"is to help you see what an end-to-end working integration flow looks "
"like. It is our hope that this will help you have something to build "
"against. For more info, check out our docs: "
"http://keybase.io/docs/proof_integration_guide\n")
