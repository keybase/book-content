# Security on Keybase
TL;DR Public-key cryptography makes it easy for you to safely and securely share or store anything you want on Keybase.

#### Your account is protected by public-key cryptography.
Your Keybase [account](/accounts) is protected by public-key cryptography. Your [devices](/accounts/devices) are cryptographically linked to your account, ensuring that only you can access it. 

[Proofs](/accounts/proofs) and [following](/accounts/following) help ensure that you’re really you on Keybase. They’re backed by public-key cryptography. 

#### Everything you store or share on Keybase is end-to-end encrypted.
Everything you store or share through your Keybase account—in [Chat](/chat), [Files](/files), [Teams](/teams), [Git](/git), [Sites](/sites), and [Wallet](/wallet)—is automatically end-to-end encrypted. Only you and your intended recipients can read what you share. Not even Keybase can access it.
