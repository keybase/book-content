# Security on Keybase
Your Keybase [account](/accounts) is protected by public-key cryptography. Your [devices](/accounts/devices), [proofs](/accounts/proofs), and [following](/accounts/following) help ensure that you’re really you on Keybase and that only you have access to your account. 

Everything you share through your Keybase account—in [Chat](/chat), [Files](/files), [Teams](/teams), [Git](/git), [Sites](/sites), and [Wallet](/wallet)—is automatically end-to-end encrypted. Only you and your intended recipients can read what you share. Not even Keybase can access it.
