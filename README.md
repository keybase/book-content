# 📝 Keybase Book Content

👋 Hey there! Welcome to the [Keybase](https://keybase.io) Book content repo!

## Creating a Highlighted Content Section

To create a callout section, like a `TL;DR` or `Tip`, etc, use the following markup within the Markdown files:

```html
<div class="compose-highlight" data-text="tl;dr">
  Keep your most important documents, photos, and videos safe and secure with Files.
</div>
```

The `data-text` prop on the container will render as the title of the callout section.
