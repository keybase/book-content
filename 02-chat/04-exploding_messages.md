## Exploding messages
If you send an exploding message, it will permanently disappear after a given period of time, just like you’re Inspector Gadget’s boss. {# Note: IG is a temp reference: I need to look up how ephemeral messages are referenced on Insta, SnapChat #} On Keybase, an exploded message is guaranteed to totally disappear after your chosen period of time. No one will be able to find or read it, even if they have access to your device. 

**To send an exploding message:**  
1. Start a chat with the person or team you with to send the message to.
2. In the Write a message field, select the timer icon (insert icon?) on the left.
3. Select the time period you would like your message to be available for.
4. Write your message. 

You will get confirmation after your message has been exploded. The word “exploded” will replace your message.

{Question: What is the point of this feature? Not sure of the best place to talk about this if we do need to talk about it ~ dumping in [Other] for now. }

#### Link previews

{Question/note: I need help understanding why this is an important/useful feature: doesn’t pretty much every chat app generate a link preview? What is the significance of not exposing IP address?}
