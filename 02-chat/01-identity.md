# Chatting with individuals and groups
All of your chats with individuals or groups of people (aka "small teams" or any group that's not a "big team") are at the top of your "inbox." This section of chat functions like a super-duper secure and searchable version of messaging on your phone. 

You can chat with someone you know on the internet by searching for a social identity: Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, Reddit, or Hacker News. Or, you chat with someone you know IRL by searching for their email or phone number.  You can manage notifications for each chat TK: Something about what happens when you send a chat to someone who isn’t yet on Keybase  

All of your chats with "big teams" are in the lower part of your "inbox." Learn more about [big teams].

## Contact info
By default, other Keybase users may start a chat with you by searching for your email or phone number. But, you can make that information unsearchable. You can also choose whether or not you wish to share your contacts with Keybase.

**To make your email and phone number unsearchable:**  
1. On your device or computer, open the Hamburger menu (insert icon?).
2. Navigate to Settings.
3. Navigate to Your account.
4. Under Email & phone, select the gear icon (insert icon?) to the right of your email and phone number. 
5. Select Make unsearchable for each email and phone number you wish to make unsearchable. Your action will be confirmed with the text “Not searchable” under your information.

Your contacts are not automatically imported into Keybase. You must allow Keybase to import your contacts. If you choose to import your contacts to Keybase, you can always remove them. 

**To remove contacts:**  
1. On your mobile device, open the Hambuger menu (insert icon?).
2. Navigate to Settings.
3. Select Phone contacts.
4. Select Remove contacts.
