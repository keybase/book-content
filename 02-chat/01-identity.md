# Inbox
All of your chats on Keybase are organized in one inbox. Your chats with individuals and groups of people are grouped at the top. Your chats with teams are grouped below. This lets you see all of your chats, from a high level, in one place.

You can start a new chat with someone you know on the internet by searching for their social identity on Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, Reddit, or Hacker News. Or, you chat with someone you know IRL by searching for their email or phone number. If you start a chat with someone who doesn’t have a Keybase account, they will have to create one before they can receive your message.

Chats with individuals and groups work similarly to SMS and group texts (but, in case you forgot, they’re super duper secure). New messages move a conversation to the top of your inbox.   

## Teams
Teams are useful for chats and file sharing with large groups, organizations, companies, and communities. 

If you want to be able to add and remove people from a group chat, you need to create a team. Teams also allow you to organize chats by adding channels. 

Channels are useful for focused chats on say, a specific project or lunch ideas, but they are not private. **Everyone on a team can search and read all messages and files shared in any and every channel.** To create chats or share files that are private to specific team members, you need to [make a subteam](link to subteam section). 

You can also reply privately to messages within team chats. Those chats move to the top of your inbox, outside of the team chat, and always remain private between you and that other person.
 
There are lots more features that are useful for teams. Skip ahead to [learn more](link to teams section).
 
## Chat history
Your entire history of messages and files shared in chats are searchable and readable by everyone in the chat on a team (except for exploded messages, of course). 
 
In teams, owners can determine the length of chat history. Messages can be auto-deleted never, or at set intervals as short as 30 seconds and as long as 365 days. 
 
But, so long as you choose to keep your chat history, you’ll always be able to dig into all of it. 
 
## Notifications
You can manage the chat notifications you do or don’t want to receive for every chat or channel. Notifications can be sent to your desktop or mobile device. 
 
Chat notifications only share that a message was sent. Notifications do not reveal the contents of a message.
