Right now, anyone on Keybase can start a chat with anyone else on Keybase. TK: General blurb on how and why you are searchable for others on Keybase chat.

For more details, you can [read Keybaseâ€™s Privacy Policy](https://keybase.io/docs/privacypolicy).

## Blocking
If you block someone on Keybase, you will no longer see them under your followers or suggestions for following. But please note, they may be able to figure out that you blocked them. They will also be able to start a chat with you.

TK: You can also block a conversation. But TBH, blocking is not that effective. We know this a problem but is it something we can address? More info here: https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/1593

## Personal contact info
By default, other Keybase users may start a chat with you by searching for your email or phone number. But, you can make that information unsearchable. 

Your contacts are not automatically imported into Keybase. You must allow Keybase to import your contacts. If you choose to import your contacts to Keybase, you can always remove them.
