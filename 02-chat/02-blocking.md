## You control who you chat with
All accounts on Keybase are public but you can control who can chat with you and add you to a team.

If someone you don’t follow and haven’t chatted with before contacts you on Keybase, you’ll get a head’s up. With one click, you can wave to say hello, view their profile, or block them. If you just want to chat, you can do so and the notification will disappear.

### You can block people 
When you block someone on Keybase, they won’t be able to chat with you or add you to a team. You can also choose to hide them on your list of followers. {# Need to fact-check this: But they can still follow you and see your profile. They won’t be notified that you blocked them but they may be able to find out that you blocked them [because they won’t be able to chat with you or add you to a team]. #}

### You can report people 
If someone’s acting inappropriately on Keybase or their account looks fake, you can report them. {# What happens when you report someone? When you report someone, their account is reviewed by our team. We censor any and all calls to violence. But what else? #}

### You have more options, too
Under chat settings, you can further manage who can chat with you or add you to a team. If you select, ``Only let someone message me or add me to a team if…`` you’ll get another set of options that include: I follow them, I follow someone who follows them, they’re in a team with me.
