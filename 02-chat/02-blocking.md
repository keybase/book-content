## Blocking & reporting in chat
All accounts on Keybase are public but you can control who can chat with you and add you to a team.

### Control who you chat with
If someone you don’t follow and haven’t chatted with before contacts you on Keybase, you’ll get a head’s up. With one click, you can wave to say hello, view their profile, or block them. If you want to chat, start typing and the notification will automatically disappear.

#### Block people you don’t want to interact with
When you block someone, they won’t be able to chat with you or add you to a team. You can also remove them from your public list of followers. You won’t see them and their account will not be publicly associated with yours. 

But they can still follow you. They may also know that you blocked them (because they won’t be able to chat with you or add you to a team).

#### Report people who are acting inappropriately
When you report someone, we review their account as quickly as humanly possible. We will remove people that have violated our [terms](https://keybase.io/docs/terms). Please provide additional information so we can remove spammers, abusers, and harassers even faster.

#### Lock down your account
You can further manage who can chat with you or add you to a team, under chat settings. If you select, ``Only let someone message me or add me to a team if…`` you’ll get another set of options that include: I follow them, I follow someone who follows them, they’re in a team with me.
