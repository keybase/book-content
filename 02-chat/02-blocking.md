## Privacy 
All Keybase accounts are public, but you can control who can chat or otherwise interact with you by blocking, reporting, and/or restricting contacts.

Plus, if someone you don’t follow and haven’t chatted with before contacts you on Keybase, you’ll automatically get a heads up. You can choose to wave hello, view their account profile, or block them. If you want to chat, just start typing and the notification will automatically disappear.

### Blocking
When you block someone, they won’t be able to chat with you or add you to a team. You can also remove them from your public list of followers. You won’t see them, and their account will not be publicly associated with yours.

But they can still follow you. They may also know that you blocked them because they won’t be able to chat with you or add you to a team.

### Reporting
When you report someone, we review their account as quickly as humanly possible. We will remove people that have violated our [terms](https://keybase.io/docs/terms). Please provide additional information so we can remove spammers, abusers, and harassers even faster.

#### Restricting contacts
You can further restrict who can chat with you or add you to a team, under Settings > Chat. 

You can select a box that gives you options to only let someone message you or add you to a team if:
* you follow them,
* you follow someone who follows them, or
* they’re in a particular team with you.

If you select the team option, you can further specify which teams.
