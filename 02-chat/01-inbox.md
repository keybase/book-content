## Chat and share securely
All of your chats on Keybase are organized in one secure inbox. 

Chats with individuals, groups, and teams are collected at the top. If you’re part of a big team (a team chat with channels), those chats will be grouped below.  

To start new chats quickly, find your contacts by name, email, or phone number; or by username from other platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and GitHub.

If you start a chat with someone who doesn’t have a Keybase account, they’ll have to create one before they can receive your message.

Chats with individuals and groups work similarly to SMS and group texts (but, in case you forgot, they’re super duper secure). New messages move a conversation to the top of your inbox.   

### Team chats
If you want to add or remove people from a group, you need to turn it into a team. Teams also allow you to organize chats by adding channels. If you add channels to a chat, your team becomes a big team (and moves to the lower part of your inbox).

You can reply privately to messages within team chats. Those chats move to the top of your inbox, outside of the team chat, and always remain private between you and that other person.

#### Channels and subteams
You can create channels to organize chats (on say, a specific project or lunch ideas) but they are not private. Everyone on a team can search and read all messages and files shared in any and every channel. 

To create chats or share files that are private to specific team members, you need to [make a subteam](/teams#subteams). 

Skip ahead to [learn more about teams](/teams).
 
### Chat history
Your entire history of messages and files shared in chats is searchable and readable by everyone on the team, including new team members. 
 
In team chats, owners can determine the length of chat history. Messages can be auto-deleted never, or at set intervals as short as 30 seconds and as long as 365 days. Individual messages can also be set to explode after a certain time period.
 
But, so long as you choose to keep your chat history, you’ll always be able to dig into all of it.
