## Individuals and groups
To start new chats quickly, you can find your contacts by name, email, or phone number; or by username from other platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and GitHub.

If you start a chat with someone who doesn’t have a Keybase account, they’ll have to create one before they can receive your message. This helps ensures that only your intended recipients can read your messages.

You can use Keybase for Chat just like you would group messages on your phone. Except, of course, it’s super, super secure. But you can also do a lot more if you turn a group into a team.

## Teams
If you turn a group chat into a team, you can add or remove people from it. [Teams](/teams) also allow you to organize chats by adding channels. If you add channels, your team becomes what we call a big team.

### Private messages
You can reply privately to messages within team chats. Those chats move outside of the team chat and always remain private between you and that other person.

### Channels
You can create channels to organize chats (on say, a specific project or lunch ideas), but they’re not private. Everyone on a team can search and read all messages and files shared in any and every channel. 

### Subteams
To create chats or share files that are private to specific team members, you need to [make a subteam](/teams#subteams). 

### Chat history
Your entire chat history of messages and files is searchable and readable by everyone on a team, including new team members.

In team chats, owners can determine how long chat history is saved. Messages can be auto-deleted never or at set intervals from 30 seconds to 365 days. Individual messages can also be set to [explode](chat/features) after a certain time period.

So long as you choose to keep your chat history, you’ll always be able to dig into all of it.
