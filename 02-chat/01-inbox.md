## Chat and share securely
Message friends, share sensitive information with colleagues, or organize entire projects. All of your chats on Keybase are organized in one secure inbox.

### With individuals
To start new chats quickly, find your contacts by name, email, or phone number; or by username from other platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and GitHub.

If you start a chat with someone who doesn’t have a Keybase account, they’ll have to create one before they can receive your message. 

Chats with individuals and groups work similarly to SMS and group texts (but, in case you forgot, they’re super duper secure). New messages move a conversation to the top of your inbox.   

### With groups of people
You can use Chat on Keybase just like you would group messages on your phone. But you can also do a lot more.

If you want to add or remove people from a group, turn it into a team. [Teams](/teams) also allow you to organize chats by adding channels. If you add channels to a chat, your team becomes a big team (and moves to the lower part of your inbox).

#### Keep private messages private
You can reply privately to messages within team chats. Those chats move outside of the team chat and always remain private between you and that other person.

#### Organize with channels 
You can create channels to organize chats (on say, a specific project or lunch ideas) but they’re not private. Everyone on a team can search and read all messages and files shared in any and every channel. 

#### Get more privacy with subteams
To create chats or share files that are private to specific team members, you need to [make a subteam](/teams#subteams). Learn more about subteams in [Teams](/teams).
 
#### Manage chat history
Your entire history of messages and files shared in Chat is searchable and readable by everyone on the team, including new team members. 
 
In team chats, owners can determine how long chat history is saved. Messages can be auto-deleted never or at set intervals from 30 seconds to 365 days. Individual messages can also be set to [explode](chat/features) after a certain time period.
 
So long as you choose to keep your chat history, you’ll always be able to dig into all of it.
