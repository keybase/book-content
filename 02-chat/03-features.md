## Do more with Chat
 The cryptography that powers Keybase Chat also lets you do a lot of things you can’t do in other chat apps, like share your live location, make extra-sensitive messages explode, or flip a coin. 

You can also send or request funds over chat, in Lumens or any other currency you choose. Learn more in [Wallet](/wallet).

### Share your location
You can securely share your location with any individual, group, or team on Chat. You can even share your live location for a set period of time and it will automatically update as you move. 

When you do so, only the person or people you intend to share your location with will receive it. Not even Keybase will know where you are. 

### Make messages explode
If you send an exploding message, it will be permanently erased after your chosen period of time. It won’t be searchable. No one will ever be able to find or read it, not even if they have access to your device. It will have disappeared into thin air.

### Flip a coin
If you need to make a really important decision—should you take that job? Buy a Corvette?—Keybase can help. Type `/flip` into a chat, and you’ll get a totally randomized heads-or-tails coin flip. 

You’ll also see that there are lots of other randomly generated things you can use for more fun: roll a die, pick a random number in a range, shuffle a list of items, and more.
