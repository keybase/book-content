Like most other chat apps, you can send people GIFs and emoji-laden messages. But Keybase lets you do a lot of other things that you can’t do in other places, like share your location, make extra-sensitive messages explode, or flip a coin. 

You can even send or request funds over chat, in Lumens or any other currency you choose. Learn more about that in the [Wallet chapter](/wallet).

## Location sharing
You can securely share your location through a chat with any individual, group, or team. You can even share your live location for a set period of time and it will automatically update as you move. 

When you do so, only the person or people you intend to share your location with will receive it. Not even Keybase will know your location. 

## Exploding messages
If you send an exploding message, it will permanently disappear after your chosen period of time (just like on Inspector Gadget). It won’t be searchable. No one will be able to find or read it, not even if they have access to your device. 

## Coin flip
If you need to make a really important decision — Should you take that job? Buy a Corvette? — Keybase can help. Type `/flip` into a chat, and you’ll get a totally randomized heads-or-tails coin flip. 

You’ll also see that there are lots of other randomly generated things you can use for more fun: roll a die, pick a random number in a range, shuffle a list of items, and more.
