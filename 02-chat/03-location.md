# Special features
Like most other chat apps, you can send people GIFs and emoji-laden messages. But Keybase lets you do a lot of other things that you can’t do other places, like share your location, make extra-sensitive messages explode, or flip a coin. 

You can even send or request funds over chat, in Lumens or any other currency you choose. [Learn more about that in Wallets](link to Wallets).

## Location sharing
You can securely share your location through a chat with any individual, group, or team. You can even share your live location for a set period of time and it will automatically update as you move. 

When you do so, only the person or people you intend to share your location with will receive it. Not even Keybase will know your location. To learn about how this works, [read more about location sharing](https://keybase.io/docs/chat/location).

## Exploding messages
If you send an exploding message, it will permanently disappear after a given period of time (just like on Inspector Gadget). On Keybase, an exploded message is guaranteed to totally disappear after your chosen period of time. It will not be searchable. No one will be able to find or read it, even if they have access to your device. 

You will get confirmation after your message has been exploded. The word “exploded” will replace your message.
