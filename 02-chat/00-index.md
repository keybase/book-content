# Chat
You can use chat on Keybase to communicate with anyone you know — even if you only have their social profile handle, email, or phone number. You can communicate directly with individuals or with groups of people by [creating a team or subteam](link to chapter(s) about teams and subteams). 

Like everything else on Keybase, the messages and files you send through chat are encrypted and secure. When you communicate with someone on Keybase, you can be 100% sure your conversation is just between you and that person — not even Keybase can read your messages. And, your messages will be delivered exactly as you sent them, even when you’re using a weak or spotty internet connection. 

Keybase’s encryption enables some other fancy features like exploding messages, link previews, secure location sharing, and coin flips. Read on to learn more about them and other basic security features in Keybase chat.

To learn more about how encryption supports chat on Keybase, you can [read this overview](https://keybase.io/docs/chat/crypto).

{# Question: There is some information that could go in the following sections that may be redundant with other sections. I’m generally in favor of redundant info in scenarios like this but do other people have opinions. E.g. Should we put redundant email, phone, and desktop/mobile notification information under each relevant section: chat, following, team admins? Also: you are automatically opted in for Keybase’s “once in a great while” emails. Seems like bad form? Why and where should we address that? #}

{# Question: If someone starts a chat with a user who isn’t on Keybase via an email address, the Keybase user is prompted to share a Join Keybase link *and* the new user gets an email notification asking them to join Keybase. What happens when someone tries to start a chat with someone who has an unsearchable email or via a Twitter handle or other profile info? Is it up to the Keybase user to send them a link to Join Keybase to get the chat? #}

{# Note: Organization of all the items in this chapter in very, very rough. Just a first pass at getting relevant info down. Need to spend more time thinking about which features are most important to include as H2s and what else people would expect to find with them. #}
