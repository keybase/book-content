## Share messages and files with anyone
Chat with anyone: individuals, groups of people, or teams. 

All of your messages and files—anything you share on Keybase Chat—are end-to-end encrypted and secure. 

[**Your inbox**](/chat/inbox)  
All of your chats—with individuals, small teams, and big teams—are organized in one place: your inbox. [Learn more](/chat/inbox).

[**Blocking**](/chat/blocking)  
You can block people to manage who can and can’t chat with you. You can also report people or lock down your account for more privacy. [Learn more](/chat/blocking).

[**Special features**](/chat/special-features)  
Keybase’s encryption enables some special features like location sharing, exploding messages, and coin flips. [Learn more](/chat/special-features).

{# Nice to have a stylized blurb that says something like: Chat on Keybase is entirely encrypted, private, and secure. You can be 100% sure your conversation is just between you and that person. No one else, not even Keybase, can read your messages. #}
