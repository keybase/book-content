# Chat
Message friends, share important info with colleagues, or organize entire projects. All of your chats on Keybase happen in one secure inbox. 

Anything you share—all of your messages and files—is end-to-end encrypted. Your messages can only be read by your intended recipient(s). Private messages stay private. Account admins and owners can’t snoop. 

{# Nice to have a stylized blurb that says something like: Chat on Keybase is entirely encrypted, private, and secure. You can be 100% sure your conversation is just between you and that person. No one else, not even Keybase, can read your messages. #}

You can chat with individuals or groups, [block people](/chat/blocking) you don’t want to chat with, and get even more done with [special features](/chat/special-features) like location sharing, exploding messages, coin flips, and bots.
