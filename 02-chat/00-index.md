## Share messages and files with anyone

You can use chat on Keybase to share messages and files with anyone you know IRL or online: individuals, groups of people, or teams. 

[**Your inbox**](/chat/inbox)
All of your chats — with individuals, small teams, and big teams — are organized in one place: your inbox.

[**Blocking**](/chat/blocking)
You can manage who can and can't chat with you with blocking. You can also report users who are behaving inappropriately or lock down your account for more privacy. 

[**Special features**](/chat/special-features)
Keybase’s encryption enables some special features like location sharing, exploding messages, and coin flips. 

{# nice to have a visual blurb that says something like: Chat on Keybase is entirely encrypted, private, and secure. You can be 100% sure your conversation is just between you and that person. No one else, not even Keybase, can read your messages. #}
