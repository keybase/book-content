# Keybase for Chat
Message friends, share important info with colleagues, or organize entire projects. All of your chats on Keybase happen in one secure inbox. 

Anything you share—all of your messages and files—is end-to-end encrypted. Your messages can only be read by your intended recipient(s). Private messages stay private. 

You can chat with individuals or groups, [block people](/chat/blocking) you don’t want to chat with, and get even more done with [special features](/chat/special-features) like location sharing, exploding messages, coin flips, and bots.
