## Keybase for Chat
Chat with anyone: individuals, groups of people, or teams. 

Anything you share in Chat—all of your messages and files—are end-to-end encrypted and secure. 
{# Nice to have a stylized blurb that says something like: Chat on Keybase is entirely encrypted, private, and secure. You can be 100% sure your conversation is just between you and that person. No one else, not even Keybase, can read your messages. #}

All of your chats are organized in [your inbox](/chat/inbox). You can [block people](/chat/blocking) you don’t want to chat with. You can also try out [special features](/chat/special-features) like location sharing, exploding messages, and coin flips.
