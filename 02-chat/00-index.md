You can use chat on Keybase to share messages and files with anyone you know IRL or online: individuals, groups of people, or teams. All of your chats are organized in one place, in your inbox.

When you chat with someone on Keybase, you can be 100% sure your conversation is just between you and that person. No one else, not even Keybase, can read your messages. 

Everything you send through chat is encrypted and secure. Your messages and files will be delivered exactly as you sent them, even when you’re using a weak or spotty internet connection. 

Keybase’s encryption enables some other special features like location sharing, exploding messages, and coin flips.
