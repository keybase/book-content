# Creating an account
Before you can create a Keybase account, you need to install the app on your computer or device. Using Keybase through your web browser will only give you very basic functionality. For example, you can sign in to your account but you can’t do much else. So, download and install the app. 
As a head’s up, you’ll need to allow Keybase to install a new helper tool. Enter your computer or device’s password to allow the installation.

## Username  
You may want to think about your username in advance because: 

**Your username is public and it cannot be changed.**

Choosing your username is the first thing in a series of things you’ll do to help establish your trustworthy identity on Keybase. Changing your username has the potential to undo everything that helps confirm that you are who you say you are. 

We know there are lots of reasons people may need to change their usernames. And there are solutions we could implement to help people do so. But they’re complicated and, unfortunately, not something we can work on right now. In the meantime, we appreciate your patience. You can [read a more detailed explanation on GitHub](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/2842#issuecomment-283706335).

## Device names
Choose your device names carefully as well. They’re also public and can’t be changed. Like your username, your devices help make your Keybase account secure and trustworthy. You can [learn more about this in Devices](link to Devices section).

## Password
You don’t need to create a password for your Keybase account unless you sign out of the app on your device. The cryptography that Keybase uses is more secure than passwords. You can [learn more about this in People](link to People section).

## Keybase is free. Forever?
For now, Keybase is free for everyone. But even if we change our business model, and for example, charge for large teams or enterprises, we promise to keep Keybase free for everyone already using the app, as well as for personal and community use.
