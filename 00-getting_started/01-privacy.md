## Keep private stuff private  
Your messages and files on Keybase are end-to-end encrypted. Not even Keybase can access them.  

But accounts on Keybase can’t be totally private. And some public info can’t be totally deleted. To hopefully avoid any confusion or embarrassing moments, we’re gonna lay it all out.

### Your data is your data 
You can and should read our whole [privacy policy](https://keybase.io/docs/privacypolicy). It’s not too long and you can skip around to find the info that’s most important to you. 

The gist is that Keybase won’t sell or rent your data or content for any reason. Again, we can’t even access it. And, we’ll never rely on ads for revenue. Eventually, we may charge for special features for larger corporations. (But individual and existing accounts will always be free.)
 
#### Your data is secure
It may seem strange, but you won’t be asked to create a password when you set up your account. The cryptography Keybase uses is exponentially more secure than passwords. Learn how in [Security](/getting-started/security).

### Some of your info is public 
Public-key cryptography ensures that private info stays private on Keybase. But public-key cryptography works best when public keys are, well, public. (Learn more in [Security](getting-started/security).)

So, anyone on the internet can search, find, and see your Keybase account and some information associated with it, including:
* your username 
* device names 
* your public key
* anything else you choose to share on your profile—maybe a photo, short biography, or your location 

Your username, device names, and public key also can’t be deleted. These pieces of information are basically cryptographically linked to your Keybase account. They’re all part of a public record that bolsters the [security](getting-started/security) of your account. 

#### Your username is public and can’t be changed or deleted 
Before you create your account, give your username some thought. Anyone on the internet can see it and it can’t be changed or deleted.

Choosing your username is the first thing in a series of things you’ll do to help establish [your account](/your-account) — which is basically your online identity — on Keybase. Changing it has the potential to undo everything that helps confirm that you are who you say you are. 

We know there are lots of reasons why people may need to change their usernames. And there are solutions we could implement to help people do so. But they’re complicated and, unfortunately, not something we can work on right now. In the meantime, you can learn more about this issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/2842#issuecomment-283706335).

#### Device names are public and can’t be changed or deleted
You’ll also name the computer and/or devices you download Keybase on. Device names are also visible to everyone on the internet and can’t be changed or deleted.

Again, choose carefully. Your devices help make your Keybase account secure and trustworthy. Devices can be revoked, Learn more in [Devices](/account/devices).

You can revoke devices to indicate that they are no longer in your use or have otherwise changed. 

### Block and report bad actors
You can control who can interact with you on Keybase. You can block and report people on an individual basis. Or, you can limit who can chat with you and add you to a team. Learn more in [Chat](chat/blocking).

When you block someone, they’re removed from your public list of followers. You won’t see them and their account will not be publicly associated with yours. But they can still follow you. 

When you report someone, we review their account as quickly as humanly possible. We will remove people that have violated our [terms](https://keybase.io/docs/terms). Please provide additional information so we can remove spammers, abusers, and harassers even more quickly.

{# **Notes/Scraps** #}
{# On Keybase, anyone can find anyone else’s public key and know that it’s absolutely the right one without having to use any other (potentially vulnerable and hackable) channels of communication.

Keeping public keys public makes sure that everyone has access to all the features and functionality on Keybase. It also helps ensure that you get the messages and files that are intended for you.

You can trust that people are who they say they are on Keybase — not just because they say they are, and not just because Keybase says they are, but — because absolutely anyone can double-check and be sure that they are. This is also why you can’t use private Twitter or GitHub account as proofs. If accounts are private, not everyone can verify them, and the system breaks down. #}
