## Privacy on Keybase  
Messages and files on Keybase are end-to-end encrypted. All your secrets are safe. Not even Keybase can access them.

But accounts on Keybase can’t be completely private. For example, everyone on the internet can see your profile photo. And, some public info can’t be deleted. To help avoid any confusion or embarrassing moments, we’ll lay it all out.

Tip: Your username and device names on Keybase are public and can’t be changed or deleted. Give them some thought before you create your account.

### Your data is your data
You can and should read our whole [privacy policy](https://keybase.io/docs/privacypolicy). It’s not too long and you can skip around to find the info that’s most important to you.

The gist is that Keybase won’t sell or rent your data or content for any reason. Again, we can’t even access it. And, we’ll never rely on ads for revenue. Eventually, we may charge for special features for larger corporations. (But individual and existing accounts will always be free.)

#### Your data is secure
It may seem strange, but you won’t be asked to create a password when you set up your account. The cryptography Keybase uses is more secure than passwords. Learn more in [Security](/getting-started/security).

### Some of your info is public
Public-key cryptography ensures that private info stays private on Keybase. But public-key cryptography works best when public keys are, well, public. (Learn more in [Security](getting-started/security).)

So, anyone on the internet can search, find, and see your Keybase account and some information associated with it, including:
* Your username
* Device names
* Your public key
* Your followers and who you follow
* Your other social accounts (e.g., Twitter, GitHub, Reddit)
* Anything else you choose to share on your profile—maybe a photo, short biography, or your location

#### Your username is public and can’t be changed or deleted
Before you create your account, give your username some thought. Anyone on the internet can see it, and it can’t be changed or deleted.

Choosing your username is the first thing in a series of things you’ll do to help establish [your account](/your-account)—which is basically your online identity—on Keybase. Changing it has the potential to undo everything that helps confirm that you are who you say you are.

We know there are lots of reasons why people may need to change their usernames. And there are solutions we could implement to help people do so. But they’re complicated and, unfortunately, not something we can work on right now. In the meantime, you can learn more about this issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/2842#issuecomment-283706335).

#### Device names are public and can’t be changed or deleted
You’ll also name the computer and/or devices you install Keybase on. Device names are also visible to everyone on the internet and can’t be changed or deleted.

Again, choose carefully. Your devices help make your Keybase account secure and trustworthy. Devices can be revoked to to indicate that they’re no longer in use or have otherwise changed. Learn more in [Devices](/account/devices).

### You can block and report bad actors
You can control who can interact with you on Keybase. You can block and report people on an individual basis. You can also limit who can chat with you and add you to a team. Learn more in [Chat](chat/blocking).

When you block someone, they’ll no longer be able to chat, share files, or otherwise contact you through Keybase. If you’re on a team together, you may still be able to see messages they share with that team. But you can also choose to block entire conversations and/or teams.

You can also remove people you block from your public list of followers. You won’t see them, and their account will not be publicly associated with yours. But they can still follow you.

When you report someone, we review their account as quickly as humanly possible. We will remove people that have violated our [terms](https://keybase.io/docs/terms). Please provide additional information so we can remove spammers, abusers, and harassers even more quickly.
