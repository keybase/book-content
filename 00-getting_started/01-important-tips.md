## Things to know before you get started
The most important thing is that your Keybase account and everything you share through it are encrypted and secure. Not even Keybase can access your data. This means we’ll never sell or rent your data or content. (We couldn’t, even if we wanted to do. But rest assured, we really don’t want to.)

You should also know that some of your information is public. It’s a good idea to know what’s what before you create your account.

### Some of your info is public
Public-key cryptography ensures that private info stays private on Keybase. But public-key cryptography works best when public keys are, well, public. (Learn more about why in [Crypto 101](getting-started/crypto-101.)

So, anyone on the internet can see your Keybase account and some information associated with it, including your username, device names, your public key, proofs, followers, and anything else you choose to share (maybe a photo, short biography, or your location). 

#### Your username is public. 
Before you create your account, give your username some thought. Anyone on the internet can see it and it can’t be changed.

Choosing your username is the first thing in a series of things you’ll do to help establish your account Keybase. Changing it has the potential to undo everything that helps confirm that you are who you say you are. 

We know there are lots of reasons why people may need to change their usernames. And there are solutions we could implement to help people do so. But they’re complicated and, unfortunately, not something we can work on right now. In the meantime, you can learn more about this issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/2842#issuecomment-283706335).

#### Device names are public.
You’ll also name the computer and/or devices you download Keybase on. Device names are also public and can’t be changed.

Again, choose carefully. Your devices also help make your Keybase account secure and trustworthy. Learn more in [Devices](/account/devices).

### Your data is secure
It may seem strange, but you won’t be asked to create a password when you set up your account. That’s because you don’t need one unless you sign out of the app. The cryptography that Keybase uses is exponentially more secure than passwords. Learn how in [Crypto 101](/getting-started/crypto-101).

### Keybase is free
For now, Keybase is free for everyone. Keybase is [financially supported](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-stellar) by the [Stellar Development Foundation](https://www.stellar.org/foundation/). 

In the future, we may change our business model and charge for large teams or enterprises. But, we promise to keep Keybase free for everyone already using the app, as well as for personal and community use. 

But we will never sell or rent your data or content. By design, we can’t even access — let alone sell, transmit, or otherwise use — your encrypted content. So, go forth and enjoy or read our entire [privacy policy](https://keybase.io/docs/privacypolicy).
