# Important tips
Before you can create a Keybase account, you need to install the app on your personal computer or device. 

As a head’s up, you’ll need to allow Keybase to install a new helper tool. Enter your computer or device’s password to allow the installation.

While the app’s installing, there are a few things you should think about. 

## Your username  
To create your Keybase account, you’ll need to choose your username. But please note:

**Your username is public and it cannot be changed.**

Choosing your username is the first thing in a series of things you’ll do to help establish your trustworthy identity on Keybase. Changing your username has the potential to undo everything that helps confirm that you are who you say you are. 

We know there are lots of reasons people may need to change their usernames. And there are solutions we could implement to help people do so. But they’re complicated and, unfortunately, not something we can work on right now. In the meantime, we appreciate your patience. 

You can [read a more detailed explanation on GitHub](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/2842#issuecomment-283706335).

## Device names
You’ll also have to create a name for your computer or device — and for any other device you add to Keybase. Like your username, device names are public and can’t be changed. Again, choose carefully. 

Your devices help make your Keybase account secure and trustworthy. [Learn more](link to Devices section).

## On passwords
It may seem strange, but you won’t be asked to create a password when you set up your account. That’s because you don’t need one unless you sign out of the app. The cryptography that Keybase uses is way more secure than passwords. You can [learn why in People](link to People section).

## Keybase is free
For now, Keybase is free for everyone. [Keybase is financially supported](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-stellar) by the [Stellar Development Foundation](https://www.stellar.org/foundation/). 

In the future, we may change our business model and charge for large teams or enterprises. But, we promise to keep Keybase free for everyone already using the app, as well as for personal and community use. So, go forth and enjoy!
