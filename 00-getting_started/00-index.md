## Connect, share, and get work done safely and securely
Chat, collaborate, manage files, and more on Keybase. Keybase has all the tools you need to connect, share, and get work done safely and securely. 

Keybase is free and will never be supported by adds. Your data is your data for ever and ever. Keybase canâ€™t even access it. 

Multiple layers of encryption ensure that Keybase is more secure than other apps.

[**Security**](/getting-started/security)  
Encryption makes your Keybase account way more secure than anything that requires just a username and password. [Learn more](/getting-started/security).
