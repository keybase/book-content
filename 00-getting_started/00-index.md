## Security on Keybase
Everything you share through your Keybase account—in Chat, Files, Teams, Git, Sites, and Wallet—is automatically end-to-end encrypted. Only you and your intended recipient(s) can read what you share. Not even Keybase can access it. 

Your account itself is also protected by encryption. This is important because your account is basically your online identity. Protecting it means that all of your contacts can be sure that you are really you on Keybase. No phishing, spoofing, or scamming around here.

{# Henry: can the above blurb be offset/look special like the TL;DR and Tip blurbs? TODO: can we talk about the report in a way that validates Keybase without asking people to read the report? E.g. some sort of rating or quick summary? #}
