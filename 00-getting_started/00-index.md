## Connect and share safely and securely
Chat, collaborate, manage files, and more on Keybase. You can use it do pretty much anything you do on the internet—but safely and securely.

Keybase is free and will never be supported by adds. Your data is your data for ever and ever. Keybase can’t even access it. 

Multiple layers of encryption ensure that Keybase is more secure than other apps. 

[**Privacy**](/getting-started/privacy)  
While your Keybase account and everything you share through it are safe and secure, some of your information is public. [Learn more](/getting-started/privacy).

[**Security**](/getting-started/security)  
Encryption makes your Keybase account way more secure than anything that requires just a username and password. [Learn more](/getting-started/security).
