## Privacy & security 
Public-key cryptography secures both your Keybase account and everything you share or store in it. This ensures that your identity and data are safe. But it also means that some of your information is public. Know what’s what as you get started.

TL;DR Your contacts can be sure that you are you on Keybase. And, everything you share—in Chat, Files, Teams, Git, Sites, and Wallet—is end-to-end encrypted. No one can access your data—not even Keybase. But some information, like your username, is public.
