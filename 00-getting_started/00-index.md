## Security & privacy on Keybase
Your Keybase account is safe and secure. Everything you share through it—in Chat, Files, Teams, Git, Sites, and Wallet—is end-to-end encrypted. No one else can access your data—not even Keybase. 

Your account itself is also protected by encryption. This means all of your contacts can be sure that you are really you on Keybase. No phishing scams around here.

{# Henry: can the above blurb be offset/look special like the TL;DR and Tip blurbs? TODO: can we talk about the report in a way that validates Keybase without asking people to read the report? #}
