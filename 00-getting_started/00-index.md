## Keybase Basics
Keybase has all the tools you need to do what you need to do—safely and securely.

TL;DR Multiple layers of encryption ensure that Keybase is more private and more secure than other apps. Both your Keybase account and everything you share through it—in Chat, Files, Teams, Git, Sites, and Wallet—are end-to-end encrypted. No one can access your data—not even Keybase.

Tip: Your username and device names on Keybase are public and can’t be changed or deleted. Give them some thought before you create your account.
