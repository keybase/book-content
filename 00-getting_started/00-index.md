## Connect and share securely
You can chat, gather groups of people, store and share files, and more on Keybase. Keybase accounts are encrypted. And all of your messages and files are encrypted. This means no one can access them, not even Keybase. 

These two layers of encryption ensure Keybase’s security but it also means that the app works a little differently than others. 

### Things to know
Public-key cryptography ensures that private info stays private on Keybase. But public-key cryptography really only works when public keys are, well, public. So, anyone on the internet can see your Keybase account and some information associated with it, including your username, device names, your public key, proofs, followers, and anything else you choose to share (maybe a photo, short biography, or your location). 

#### Your username is public. 
Before you create your account, give your username some thought. Anyone on the internet can see it and it can’t be changed.

{# Might be nice to make very important things like this visually distinct for people who are just scanning. An example might be the light blue box Slack uses for Tips but less corny: https://slack.com/help/articles/205239967-Join-a-channel #} 

Choosing your username is the first thing in a series of things you’ll do to help establish a trustworthy identity on Keybase. Changing your username has the potential to undo everything that helps confirm that you are who you say you are. 

We know there are lots of reasons why people may need to change their usernames. And there are solutions we could implement to help people do so. But they’re complicated and, unfortunately, not something we can work on right now. In the meantime, you can learn more about this issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/2842#issuecomment-283706335).

#### Device names are public.
You’ll also name the computer or device you download Keybase on, and any other device you add. Device names are also public and can’t be changed.
{# Same as above -- make visually distinct for people who scan? #}

Again, choose carefully. Your devices also help make your Keybase account secure and trustworthy. Learn more in [Devices](/account/devices).

#### You don’t need a password
It may seem strange, but you won’t be asked to create a password when you set up your account. That’s because you don’t need one unless you sign out of the app. The cryptography that Keybase uses is way, way, way more secure than passwords. Learn why in [Your Account](/account).

### Keybase is free
For now, Keybase is free for everyone. Keybase is [financially supported](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-stellar) by the [Stellar Development Foundation](https://www.stellar.org/foundation/). 

In the future, we may change our business model and charge for large teams or enterprises. But, we promise to keep Keybase free for everyone already using the app, as well as for personal and community use. And, we will never sell your data or personal info. So, go forth and enjoy!
