## Do everything—safely and securely
Keybase has all the tools you need to do what you need to do safely and securely. You can chat and collaborate. Get work done, or don’t. Store and share photos, videos, or manifestos. Organize. Send money or emojis. Just don’t do it all at once—that never ends well.

Keybase is free and will never be supported by adds. Your data is your data for ever and ever. Keybase can’t even access it. 

Multiple layers of encryption ensure that Keybase is more private and more secure than other apps. This also means Keybase works a little differently.

[**Privacy**](/getting-started/privacy)  
While your Keybase account and everything you share through it are safe and secure, some of your information is public. [Learn more](/getting-started/privacy).

[**Security**](/getting-started/security)  
Encryption makes your Keybase account way more secure than anything that requires just a username and password. [Learn more](/getting-started/security).
