## Security & privacy on Keybase
Your Keybase account is safe and secure. Everything you share through it—in Chat, Files, Teams, Git, Sites, and Wallet—is end-to-end encrypted. No one else can access your data—not even Keybase.

But you don’t have to take our word for it. We built Keybase in a way that you don’t have to trust us—or our servers. You can see for yourself. Our code is [open-source](https://github.com/keybase/client). And we’ll walk through other ways the safety of your account can be double-checked.
