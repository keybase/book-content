## Keybase Basics
Keybase has all the tools you need to do what you need to do—safely and securely. You can chat, share and store files, get work done with teams, build a simple website, send funds, collaborate on Git, and more. 

TL;DR Multiple layers of encryption ensure that Keybase is more private and more secure than other apps. Both your Keybase account and everything you share through it—in Chat, Files, Teams, Git, Sites, and Wallet—are end-to-end encrypted. No one can access your data—not even Keybase.
