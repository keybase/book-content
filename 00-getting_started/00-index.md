Keybase is a free and super secure app for chats, teams, files, and more. It’s [open-source](https://github.com/keybase/client) and powered by [public-key cryptography](https://keybase.io/docs/crypto/overview). 

Cryptography ensures Keybase’s security but it also means the app works a little differently than others. Here are a few things you should know as you get started. 

## Your username  
Before you create your account, give your username some thought. It’s public and cannot be changed.

Choosing your username is the first thing in a series of things you’ll do to help establish a trustworthy identity on Keybase. Changing your username has the potential to undo everything that helps confirm that you are who you say you are. 

We know there are lots of reasons why people may need to change their usernames. And there are solutions we could implement to help people do so. But they’re complicated and, unfortunately, not something we can work on right now. In the meantime, you can [learn more about this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/2842#issuecomment-283706335).

## Device names
You’ll also name your computer or device, and any other device you add to Keybase. Like your username, device names are public and can’t be changed. Again, choose carefully. 

Your devices also help make your Keybase account secure and trustworthy. [Learn more](link to Devices section).

## On passwords
It may seem strange, but you won’t be asked to create a password when you set up your account. That’s because you don’t need one unless you sign out of the app. The cryptography that Keybase uses is way, way, way more secure than passwords. You can [learn why in the Your Account chapter](link to Your Account chapter).

## Keybase is free
For now, Keybase is free for everyone. [Keybase is financially supported](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-stellar) by the [Stellar Development Foundation](https://www.stellar.org/foundation/). 

In the future, we may change our business model and charge for large teams or enterprises. But, we promise to keep Keybase free for everyone already using the app, as well as for personal and community use. So, go forth and enjoy!
