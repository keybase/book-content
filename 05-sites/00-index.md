# Keybase Sites
One perk of [Keybase Files](/files) is that you can easily build and host a simple website in your public folder. 

## Getting started
To see how it works, type anything into a document. You can start with whatever you want but it’s kind of a tradition to try out new things on the internet with this:

```
# Hello, world!
```

This example uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) formatting (`#`). You can use [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), too. 

If you use Markdown, name your document `index.md`. If you use HTML, name your document `index.html`.

Drop this index file into your public folder. You’ll immediately see it on your home page at `https://yourusername.keybase.pub/`.

### Adding pages
To add more pages:
1. Create a new folder in your public folder. Name the folder with the page name.
2. Add an index file with your content (just remember, it’ll be public!) in it. 
3. Create a new folder for every new page.

Only **index files**, documents titled `index.md` or `index.html`, will show up on your website. 

For example, let’s say that from your home page, you want to link to another page named `foo`. To do this, create a folder named `foo` in your public folder. Add an index file to the `foo` folder, with your content in it. This new page will appear at `https://yourusername.keybase.pub/foo/`.

### Editing pages
To edit a page, open the index file, make your edits, and save it. Your changes will automatically update on your website.
