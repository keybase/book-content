# Keybase Sites
One perk of [Keybase Files](/files) is that you can easily build and host a simple website in your public folder.

## Getting started
To see how it works, type anything into a document. You can start with whatever you want, but it’s kind of a tradition to try out new things on the internet with this:

```
# Hello, world!
```

This example uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) formatting (the `#` is a header). You can use [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), too.

If you use Markdown, name your document `index.md`. If you use HTML, name your document `index.html`.

Drop this index file into your public folder. You’ll immediately see it on your home page at `https://yourusername.keybase.pub/`.

### Adding pages
To add more pages:
1. Create a new folder in your public folder. Name the folder with the page name.
2. Add an index file with your content in it (remember, it’ll be public).
3. Repeat this—create a new folder and add a new index file—for every new page.

![ !Create and organize index files in your public folder to build your site.](/img/sites-filestructure.png)

Only **index files**, documents titled `index.md` or `index.html`, will show up on your website.

For example, let’s say that from your home page, you want to link to another page named `foo`. To do this, create a folder named `foo` in your public folder. Add an index file to the `foo` folder, with your content in it. This new page will appear at `https://yourusername.keybase.pub/foo/`.

### Editing pages
To edit a page, open the index file, make your edits, and save it. Your changes will automatically update on your website.

### Learn more
If you’re so inclined, you can see a couple examples and search for others’ websites at [Keybase.pub](https://keybase.pub/).

## Custom domains
You can also use a custom domain with Keybase Sites. This lets your website appear at any domain you own instead of at `https://{username}.keybase.pub/`.

### Using kbpbot
`kbpbot` is a Keybase bot designed to help you publish your site using a custom domain.

For example, let’s say you’d like to publish your website at `myname.com`. To do so:

1. In your private Keybase folder, create a new folder with the name `yourusername,kbpbot`. Only you and `kbpbot` can access, read, and edit files in this folder.
2. Within this folder, add another folder that will hold your site’s contents. Let’s name it `my-site`. The complete folder name would be `/keybase/private/person,kbpbot/my-site`.
3. Drop any other files you’d like to publicly share on your website in this folder. You can use Markdown, HTML, CSS, and image files.

### Team folders

Any Keybase folder that `kbpbot` can read works, so you can also use a team folder (e.g., `/keybase/team/awesometeam/awesome-site`) and add `kbpbot` as a reader.

### DNS records
In order for your domain/hostname to point at the Keybase servers, you need to set up a `CNAME` record (you could also use an `ALIAS` record to forward an `A`/`AAAA` record) that points at the hostname `kbp.keybaseapi.com`. So, you’d have something like:

```
my-site.example.com. 300 IN CNAME kbp.keybaseapi.com.
```

Note that you can’t have `CNAME` on a root domain (e.g., `example.com`). Some DNS providers support it by making it a proxy for only `A`/`AAAA` records. This is sometimes called `ALIAS`. If you need to use a root domain with a Keybase Site, but your DNS provider doesn’t allow it, try switching to a different DNS provider.

In addition to the DNS record, `kbpbot` needs to know which shared folder you’d like to share on this hostname. You’ll need a `TXT` record for `_keybase_pages` as a subdomain of your hostname. In this case, that would be `_keybase_pages.my-site.example.com`. If the `_keybase_pages` prefix isn’t allowed, you may use `_keybasepages.my-site.example.com` as well.

The contents of this record are the prefix `kbp=`, and a full Keybase path to the folder you’d like to share, as created above. For this example setup, the record would look like this:

```
_keybase_pages.my-site.example.com. 300 IN TXT "kbp=/keybase/private/person,kbpbot/my-site"
```

This record tells `kbpbot` to look in this folder to share your files.

### HTTPS security
Thanks to [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), `kbpbot` is able to transparently request and install a HTTPS TLS/SSL certificate on your hosted domain name, for free.

If your configuration went smoothly, the contents of your folder are now shared over a secure HTTPS connection. 

If you added a `/keybase/private/person,kbpbot/my-site/index.html`, that file will be made available at `https://my-site.example.com/` (and also `https://my-site.example.com/index.html`). 

If you shared an image at `/keybase/private/person,kbpbot/my-site/puppy/gettingbig.jpg`, that would be available at `https://my-site.example.com/puppy/gettingbig.jpg`, etc.

## Git publishing
You can also publish your website through [Git](/git) instead of [Files](/files).

Instead of sharing a folder with [kbpbot](sites#using-kbpbot), you can create a shared Keybase Git repository and publish that.

First, you need to be on a team with `kbpbot`:
1.  In Teams, select `Create a team` and give it a name. (We’ll call this one `gitwithkbpbot`, but it can be anything.)
2.  `Add members` and invite `kbpbot` as a Reader. You can also add `kbpbot` to an existing team.  

Now you can create a Git repository to use for your new site. 
3.   In Git, select `New repository` and `New team repository`. Choose the team you share with `kbpbot`, and give the repository a name. (We’ll call this one `git-site`.)  
4.  Clone the repository and add some content to it. Push to `master`. 

The DNS configuration for Git is a little different. The main `CNAME`/`ALIAS` record is the same (points at `kbp.keybaseapi.com`). But the `TXT` record needs to tell `kbpbot` about the Git repository instead of the filesystem location like before. It looks like this:

```
my-site.example.com. 300 IN TXT "kbp=git@keybase:team/gitwithkbpbot/git-site"
```

After the regular DNS propagation delays, the pushed contents of the `master` branch of your repository will be available at `https://my-site.exampke.com`.

{# note: the old bits about private shared (no team) Git repositories seem to be deprecated; I can’t figure out how to do it if it’s still possible #}

## More customizations

By default, directory listing is disabled when you host a custom domain with Keybase. You may enable listing by creating a `.kbp_config` file at the root of your site. This config file allows some simple customizations on different parts of the site, including enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

Learn more about [`.kbp_config`](https://keybase.io/docs/kbp/kbp_config).
