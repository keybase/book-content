Before you can create a Keybase account, you need to install the app. When you sign up for your Keybase account, you create a username (that *cannot* be changed). But you *don’t* create a password. Instead, strong cryptography guarantees an association between your account and the device — e.g., your phone or computer — that you sign up with.

This association is guaranteed, which means the only way to lose your account is to lose your device. For this reason, a good next step is to add another device to your account. You can do this by installing Keybase on another device, providing your Keybase username, and then adding that device with the one you signed up with (using a QR code). After doing this, strong cryptography guarantees an association between your account and both devices.

You should also create at least one paper key, which you should store somewhere like a locked drawer at home. We recommend that you do not store a paper key on your computer, which is why we call them paper keys.

As long as you don’t lose access to all of your devices (and paper keys) at the same time, you can remove any device that you have lost or replaced, and you can add any new device that you might buy in the future.

At this point, you have control over your account in a way that is extremely reliable and trustworthy. Now you’re ready to let people know this account belongs to you.
