# Proofs

Once you’ve signed up for a Keybase account and have added another device (or two) and a paper key (or two), your ownership of your account is extremely reliable. In fact, it's much more reliable than any account protected with only a password (even with MFA). Well done.

Now you're ready to let others know your Keybase account is really yours. The best way to do this is to tell people in person, especially people you know, but there are probably people you primarily interact with online, and you want them to know your account is really yours, too.

Proofs are a good way to provide this assurance. In spirit, proofs are a simple way to let people know that the person who owns a particular Keybase account can prove they also own other online accounts, or even websites, and these proofs are public and provable.

One of the most popular social proofs to add is Twitter…

Brief history lesson? What brought us to public key cryptography and how the challenge has been reduced to knowing whether a particular public key really belongs to the person you think it belongs to.

Work in this concept? "A person is a timeline of events."
    “I exist!”
    “This Twitter account is me.”
    "This device (phone/computer/tablet) is me.”
    ”This device is no longer me, because I lost it.”

Each statement references the last one, which prevents Keybase from leaving any out maliciously (like the last statement, above).
