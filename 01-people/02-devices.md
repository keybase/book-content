# Devices

When you first sign up for Keybase, you install the app somewhere such as your computer. The app generates its own key pair and publishes the public key. From this point forward, any other device you add goes through the same process, and you verify your ownership using the same crypto. This is far, far stronger, and it's why you don't have to have a Keybase password or MFA.

Because of this, devices are effectively keys. When you send a message from your phone, for example, that message is encrypted using the private key on your phone, and the corresponding public key is verifiably part of your Keybase identity.
