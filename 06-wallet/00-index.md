# Wallet

Every Keybase account comes with a cryptocurrency wallet for Stellar Lumens. There are a couple reasons for this. One is that [Keybase is funded by the Stellar Development Foundation](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-stellar). And two is that we think Stellar is really a great decentralized, open-source, multi-currency network. Unlike most others, Stellar supports global transactions and automatically converts Lumens into whatever currency you prefer. Plus, transactions cost a fraction of a cent, are very fast, and don’t consume massive amounts of energy. 

{# Question: The above section is a little confusing bc Stellar calls itself a multi-currency network and you can exchange Lumens for any other currency. But as far as I can tell, you can only actually send and receive Lumens in the Keybase app, right? You can, for example, see their value in USD but you can’t actually send and receive USD, right?)

If you’re new to cryptocurrency, the nice thing about your Keybase wallet is that it will just work on any device you use Keybase on. You can send and receive Lumens from your wallet or chat.  If you want to know more, you can [read a more detailed explanation](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-stellar-launch). Or, join the team stellar.public under teams to chat with others about it.

{# Question: there are a lot more things that [make Stellar interesting](https://www.stellar.org/overview) but I don’t know how much detail we want or need to go into here. Is it worthwhile/interesting to include a quick crypto-primer? #}

## Sending and receiving Lumens
All of your transactions are automatically tied to your [Keybase identity] so you can easily send and receive Lumens to and from other Keybase users, Stellar addresses, or your other Stellar accounts via your wallet or chat.

**To send or receive Lumens through your wallet**
1. Hit the Hamburger menu icon.
2. Hit Wallet to open your wallet.
3. Select your recipient or user.
4. Enter the amount.
5. Hit send or request to complete your transaction.

**To send or receive Lumens through chat**
TK: slightly different experiences on mobile and desktop apps 

## Exchanging Lumens
You can [exchange Lumens into other currencies] outside of the Keybase app. To do so, you’ll need your Stellar address and secret key. 

{# Is the above correct? For some reason, I can only “Exchange” other assets directly through the app. #}

**To find your Stellar address and secret key:**
1. Go to your wallet.
2. Hit the gear icon to the right of the Send and Receive buttons at the top.
3. Hit the clipboard icon to the right of your Stellar address and secret key to copy them to your clipboard.
