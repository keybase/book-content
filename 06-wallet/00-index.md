## Keybase Wallet
You can use Keybase Wallet to store Stellar Lumens (XLM) and other currencies that are trusted through the Stellar network.

If you’re new to cryptocurrency, the nice thing about Keybase Wallet is that it just works on any device you use Keybase on. You can easily send and receive Lumens from your Wallet or Chat. And amounts are automatically converted into the currency of your choice (US dollars, for example).

If you want to learn more, read up on the [blog] (https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-stellar-launch). Or, join the team `stellar.public` to chat with others about it.

### Send and receive Lumens
All of your transactions are automatically tied to your Keybase [account](/account), so it’s quick and easy to send and receive Lumens to and from other people on Keybase, Stellar addresses, or your other Stellar accounts. You can do so in Wallet or Chat.

#### Send in Wallet
1. Select the Hamburger menu icon.
2. Select Wallet.
3. Select your recipient or username.
4. Enter the amount.
5. Select send or request to complete your transaction.

#### Send in Chat
1. Write a message that contains `+NXLM@username`. `N` is the amount and `username` is the Keybase username of the person you’d like to send the Lumens to. For example, `Thanks for picking up the tab when I forgot my wallet. +100XLM@chris`. {# The +NXLM syntax is visually confusing, because only the N is a variable. Let's think of a way to present this; we might have to rely purely on the example. #}
2. Keybase will confirm the amount and receiver of the Lumens before sending the message. It will also show you the approximate value in US dollars.

### Exchange Lumens
You can also transfer other currencies using the *Trustlines* built into the Stellar network path payments.

#### Add and manage Trustlines
1. Select the Hamburger menu icon.
2. Select Wallet.
3. Select the gear icon.
4. Select “Add Trustlines” (or “Manage Trustlines”).

{# TODO: We should decide whether we quote literal text from the app, or we `do this` instead. We seem to do both. #}

Once you’ve added another Trustline, such as `USD: anchorusd.com`, you can convert Lumens (or other currencies) to this new currency when you send funds to someone else on Keybase. Once you have another currency in your wallet, you can also send that to someone else.

You can remove trustlines in the same way, via “Manage Trustlines.” But you can’t remove all trustlines for which you have currency in your wallet. (For example, if you have USD in your wallet, you can’t remove all trustlines for USD.)

#### Send other currencies
1. Select the Hamburger menu icon.
2. Select Wallet to open your wallet.
3. Select Send.
4. Select “To a Keybase user.”
5. Select your recipient or username.
6. If the recipient has set up a Trustline for other currencies, Keybase will let you know that this person accepts funds other than XLM.
7. Select “Send other assets.”
8. Pick an asset to send and the amount (for example, “8.00 USD”).
9. Pick an asset from the “you will send approximately” section. You can convert any of the assets in your wallet to the sent currency.
10. Select “Calculate.”
11. Keybase will tell you the approximate amount you’re about to send.
12. If everything looks right to you, select “Send.”

You can also exchange Lumens into other currencies outside of  Keybase. To do so, you’ll need your Stellar address and secret key. Or, you can choose “To a Stellar address” or “To one of your other Stellar accounts” from the Send button.

{# Is the above correct? For some reason, I can only “Exchange” other assets directly through the app. -- Not sure this is correct —SC#}

#### Find your Stellar address and secret key
1. Go to your wallet.
2. Select the gear icon.
3. Select the clipboard icon to the right of your Stellar address and secret key to copy them to your clipboard.

### Stellar is stellar
 We love Stellar for a couple reasons. One is that [Keybase is funded by the Stellar Development Foundation](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-stellar). And two is that we think Stellar is actually a great decentralized, open-source, multi-currency network. Unlike most others, Stellar supports global transactions and automatically converts Lumens into whatever currency you prefer.

 Plus, transactions cost a fraction of a cent, are very fast, and don’t consume massive amounts of energy. [Bitcoin uses at least 22 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy annually—almost the same as the entire country of Ireland. Google, for the sake of comparison, used 5.7 TWh globally, in 2015.]
