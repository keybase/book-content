# Wallet

Every Keybase account comes with a cryptocurrency wallet. This wallet is primarily for Stellar Lumens (XLM), but it can hold other currencies that are trusted through the Stellar network. There are a couple reasons for this. One is that [Keybase is funded by the Stellar Development Foundation](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-stellar). And two is that we think Stellar is really a great decentralized, open-source, multi-currency network. Unlike most others, Stellar supports global transactions and automatically converts Lumens into whatever currency you prefer. Plus, transactions cost a fraction of a cent, are very fast, and don’t consume massive amounts of energy. 

If you’re new to cryptocurrency, the nice thing about your Keybase wallet is that it will just work on any device you use Keybase on. You can send and receive Lumens from your wallet or chat.  If you want to know more, you can [read a more detailed explanation](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-stellar-launch). Or, join the team `stellar.public` under teams to chat with others about it.

{# Question: there are a lot more things that [make Stellar interesting](https://www.stellar.org/overview) but I don’t know how much detail we want or need to go into here. Is it worthwhile/interesting to include a quick crypto-primer? This explanation, from the app itself, is pretty good, too: https://paste.website/p/aa4565ed-6efd-40fa-af74-cbf7b1e9f4a6.txt #}

## Sending and receiving Lumens
All of your transactions are automatically tied to your [Keybase identity](/people) so you can easily send and receive Lumens to and from other Keybase users, Stellar addresses, or your other Stellar accounts via your wallet or chat.

**To send or receive Lumens through your wallet**
1. Hit the Hamburger menu icon.
2. Hit Wallet to open your wallet.
3. Select your recipient or user.
4. Enter the amount.
5. Hit send or request to complete your transaction.

**To send or receive Lumens through chat**

To quickly send Lumens from chat, you can send a private or team message that contains the syntax `+NXLM@username` where `N` is a number and `username` is the Keybase username of the person to which you'd like to send the Lumens (the `XLM` part can also be lowercase: `xlm`). e.g. `Hey; thanks for picking up that tab when forgot my wallet. +100XLM@chris`.

Before sending this message, the Keybase app will confirm the amount and receiver of the Lumens you're about to send (and it will show you the approximate value in US Dollars). You can send or cancel at this time.


## Exchanging Lumens

In addition to sending Lumens, you can use the Wallet to transfer other currencies, using the *Trustlines* built into the Stellar network as "path payments".

**To manage Trustlines:**
1. Hit the Hamburger menu icon.
1. Hit Wallet to open your wallet.
1. Hit the gear icon.
1. Hit "Add Trustlines" (or "Manage Trustlines")

Once you've added another Trustline, such as `USD: anchorusd.com`, you can convert Lumens (or other currencies) to this new currency when sending {# we need a word for "money" #} money to someone else on Keybase. Once you have another currency in your wallet, you can also send that directly to another recipient.

Once you have Trustlines set up, you are free to remove them through the same interface (via "Manage Trustlines"), but you cannot remove all Trustlines for which you have currency in your wallet. (If you have USD in your wallet, the Keybase app will not allow you to remove all Trustlines for USD.) 

**To send a currency other than Lumens:**
1. Hit the Hamburger menu icon.
1. Hit Wallet to open your wallet.
1. Hit Send
1. Hit "To a Keybase user"
1. Select your recipient or user.
1. If the recipient has set up a Trustline for other currencies, the app will inform you that this user accepts assets other than XLM.
1. Hit "Send other assets"
1. Pick an asset to send, and the amount (such as "8.00 USD")
1. Pick an asset from the "you will send approximately" section; you can convert any of the assets in your wallet to the sent currency
1. Hit "Calculate"
1. The app will tell you the approximate amount you're about to send
1. If everything looks right to you, click "Send"


You can also [exchange Lumens into other currencies] outside of the Keybase app. To do so, you’ll need your Stellar address and secret key. Alternatively, you can choose "To a stellar address" or "To one of your other Stellar accounts" from the Send button. 

{# Is the above correct? For some reason, I can only “Exchange” other assets directly through the app. -- Not sure this is correct —SC#}

**To find your Stellar address and secret key:**
1. Go to your wallet.
2. Hit the gear icon to the right of the Send and Receive buttons at the top.
3. Hit the clipboard icon to the right of your Stellar address and secret key to copy them to your clipboard.
