# Security on Keybase
Everything you share through your Keybase account—in [Chat](/chat), [Files](/files), [Teams](/teams), [Git](/git), [Sites](/sites), and [Wallet](/wallet)—is automatically end-to-end encrypted. Only you and your intended recipients can read what you share. Not even Keybase can access it. 

Your account itself is also protected by public-key cryptography. So, all of your contacts can be sure that you’re really you on Keybase.
