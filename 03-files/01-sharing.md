Files can be organized in folders that have different privacy features: public, private, and team. You can add your own folders within these folders.

## Private 
Only you and the people you choose to share with can access files in your private folder. 

To access private files on Keybase, you must have a Keybase account. This means if you share a file with someone who doesn’t have a Keybase account, they have to create one. This is an important security measure that ensures your files are only shared with the people you intend to share them with. It also guarantees to the person you’re sharing with that the files came from you. Phishing scams and malevolent links be banned!

## Public 
Anyone on the internet can view files in your public folder. 

You can also turn your public files into a simple website. [Learn more about building a website on Keybase](link to Sites).

## Team
Files in a team folder can only be accessed by the people on a team or [subteam](link to details on subteams). Files in a team folder cannot be public.
