# Sharing

## Uploading and sharing 
{# Questions: Can you upload files from a “device” or only from a “computer”? Can you only organize (rename, add stuff to) folders from Finder? What are team permissions for folders (e.g. Anyone on a team can add stuff to a team folder but who on a team can add/organize folders?) #}
### Uploading files
You can upload files using the Keybase app or Finder (on a Mac) or TK (on Windows), on your computer. [TK: You cannot upload files from a device.]

In the Keybase app, go to the folder you want to add files to and hit upload to find the file on your computer. Or drag and drop files directly into the folder.

On your computer, Keybase is [automatically installed] as a Favorite in Finder on a Mac or TK on Windows. Drag and drop files into the appropriate folder to upload. Or save files directly to the folder in Keybase.
### Sharing files 

**Shared folders**

[You'll be able to throw data into /keybase/private/sldistin,pal@twitter, even if that Twitter user hasn't joined Keybase yet. Your app will encrypt just for you and then awake and rekey in the background when that Twitter user joins and announces a key]

**Sharing files to other apps**  

**Attaching files in a conversation**  

You can share files TK.
