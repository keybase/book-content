# Sharing

## Uploading and sharing 
{# Questions: Can you only organize (rename, add stuff to) folders from Finder? What are team permissions for folders (e.g. Anyone on a team can add stuff to a team folder but who on a team can add/organize folders? Are there any read-only permissions?) #}

### Uploading files
You can upload and store files in the cloud using the Keybase app or Finder (on a Mac) or TK (on Windows), on your computer. 

{# Question: Is this kinda stuff TMI —-> ? #} In the Keybase app, go to the folder you want to add files to and hit [illos of upload buttons on desktop and native apps?] to find the file. Or drag and drop files directly into the folder.

On your computer, Keybase is [automatically installed] as a Favorite in Finder on a Mac or TK on Windows. Drag and drop files into the appropriate folder to upload. Or you can upload or drag and drop files directly into the folder in the Keybase app.

### Sharing files  
You can share private files in a shared folder, to other apps, or in a conversation on Keybase.

**Shared folders**  
To securely share private files with another person on Keybase, you can open a shared folder with them.  Only the person you share with will be able to access the files, but to ensure the security of your files, they must have a Keybase account.

To open a shared folder:  
1. Navigate to people [icon] and search for the person you want to share with.* 
2. Go to the [profile] of the person you want to share with. 
3. Hit the button with three dots and select Open private folder. 
4. Hit Upload (in the upper right) or drag and drop files into the folder.

* If you know their username, you can also just open a new private folder and enter the usernames of the people you want to share with. For example, the folder TKyourusername,chris is private to you and Chris Coyne.

TK: You can throw data into /keybase/private/sldistin,pal@twitter, even if that Twitter user hasn't joined Keybase yet. Your app will encrypt just for you and then awake and rekey in the background when that Twitter user joins and announces a key

{# Question: If you share files with someone who is not on Keybase yet, are they notified at all? Or does the file creator have to send them a link or invite? If so, how do they do that? #}

**Sharing files to other apps**  
{# Note: If we want to include granular instructions like these, we should have them all in the same format — TBD — short paragraph or ordered list (as above). #}

You can share any file you have on Keybase to other apps you have on your device. To share a file to another app, go to the file. Tap the three dots in the upper right corner. Tap share. Tap Send to other app. Select the app you want to use.

**Attaching files in a conversation**  
You can also share files through conversations on Keybase.

To share a file in a conversation, go to the file you want to share. Tap the three dots to the right of the file. Tap share. Tap attach in other conversation. Select the conversation you want to share the file in.

{# Questions: if you share a file through conversations, can you make it explode? And/or are there other benefits of sharing through conversations? #}
