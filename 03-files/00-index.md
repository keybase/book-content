# Files
Keybase lets you store and share files securely, confidentially, and quickly.

Anything you upload to Keybase is automatically [end-to-end encrypted](link to info about encryption). This means that no one else can read or access your files (nope, not even Keybase), unless you make them public or to choose to share them with others. If and when someone accesses your files, they can be 100% certain the files were created by you (because they’re automatically [signed](link to info about signing) by you).

You can access any file on any computer or device that you use Keybase on. But files don’t take up storage space on your computer or device, they stream in and out on demand.

Individuals can store up to 250 GB across all private and public folders on Keybase. Teams and subteams can store up to 100 GB.
