Keybase lets you upload and share files securely, confidentially, and quickly. Individuals can store up to 250 GB. Teams and subteams can store up to 100 GB. 

You can access your files on any computer or device that you use Keybase on. When you install the Keybase app on your computer, Keybase files are created in Finder (on a Mac) and in Explorer (on Windows). This means that once you’ve created folders in the Keybase app, you can organize, upload, and delete files from Finder or Explorer. But your files won’t take up storage space on your computer or your device because they stream in and out on demand.

Anything you upload to Keybase is automatically end-to-end encrypted. This means that only the people you choose to share your files with can read or access them (not even Keybase can). If and when someone accesses your files, they can be 100% certain the files were created by you (because they’re automatically signed by you).
