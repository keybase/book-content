## Store everything that matters
Keep and share your most important documents, photos, and videos on Keybase Files. 

TL;DR You can store and share files easily and securely, from any device you use Keybase on. You can organize your documents into private, public, or team files.

Anything you upload to Keybase is automatically end-to-end encrypted. This means that only the people you choose to share your files with can read or access them (not even Keybase can). If and when someone accesses your files, they can be 100% certain the files were created by you (because they’re automatically signed by you).

### Manage sharing and privacy
You can upload files into public, private, or team folders, each with different privacy features. You can add and organize files and folders anyway you like inside these folders.

#### Private folders
Only you and the people you choose to share with can access files in your private folders. 

A handy way to share files with someone you know on Keybase is to create a new folder and name it like so: `yourusername,theirusername`. The people named on the folder will automatically have access to it.

To access private files on Keybase, you must have a Keybase account. This means if you share a file with someone who doesn’t have a Keybase account, they have to create one. This is an important security measure that ensures your files are only shared with the people you intend to share them with. It also guarantees to the person you’re sharing with that the files came from you. Phishing scams and malevolent links be banned.

#### Public files
Anyone on the internet can view the files in your public folder. 

You can also turn your public files into a simple website. Learn more about building a website in [Sites](/sites).

#### Team files
A new folder is automatically created for every team to share files in. Files in a team folder can only be accessed by the people on that team. But everyone on a team can access all the files in the team folder. 

If you want to share files with only specific team members,  create a subteam. Learn more in [Teams](/teams).

### Drag and drop 
When you install the Keybase app on your computer, Keybase files are automatically created in Finder (on a Mac) and in Explorer (on Windows). This means that once you’ve created folders in the Keybase app, you can organize, upload, and delete files from Finder or Explorer. 

### Stream or sync
Your Keybase Files won’t take up storage space on your computer or your device because they stream in and out as you need them. If you want files to be available when you’re offline, you can sync folder(s) to the device(s) of your choice.

Individuals can use up to 250 GB and teams can use up to 100 GB of storage on Keybase.
