# Keybase for Files
Keep your most important documents, photos, and videos safe and secure with Files.

You can easily store and share files from any device you use Keybase on. Anything you upload to Keybase is automatically end-to-end encrypted. 

Only the people you choose to share your files with can read or access them (not even Keybase can). You can keep private stuff—financial info, personal photos, your life philosophy—private.

When someone accesses files you’ve shared with them, they can be 100% certain the files came from you because they’re automatically signed by you. When a file is signed by you, your private key is used in the encryption. So, when it’s decrypted your recipient knows for certain it came from you. And rest assured, they won’t be able to see or guess your private key.

The important thing is: No phishing scams or malevolent links around here. 

## Privacy
You can store and share files in public, private, or team folders, each with different privacy features. You can add and organize files and folders any way you like inside these folders.

### Private folders
Only you and the people you choose to share with can access files in your private folders.

To quickly share files with someone on Keybase, just create a new folder and name it like so: `yourusername,theirusername`. Add as many names as you like; all the people named on the folder will automatically have access to it.

If you share a file with someone who doesn’t have a Keybase account, they’ll have to create one. This is an important security measure that ensures your files are only shared with the people you intend to share them with. It also guarantees to the person you’re sharing with that the files came from you (again, no phishing!). 

### Public folders
Anyone on the internet can view the files in your public folder. Since all of your Keybase files are signed, you can think of your public folder as a source of authenticity or authority. Anyone can view them and know that they definitely came from you.

You can also turn your public files into a simple website. Learn more in [Sites](/sites).

### Team folders
A new folder is automatically created for every team to share files in. Files in a team folder can only be accessed by the people on that team. But everyone on a team can access all the files in the team folder.

If you want to share files with only specific team members, create a subteam. Learn more in [Teams](/teams).

## Using Finder or Explorer
When you install the Keybase app on your computer, you have a choice to install an integration to make Keybase files automatically appear in Finder (on a Mac) and in Explorer (on Windows). 

This means you can drag and drop, organize, edit, and delete files right from Finder or Explorer on your desktop.

## Storage space
Your Keybase files won’t take up storage space on your computer or your device because they stream in when you need them and out when you don’t. 

To make files available when you’re offline, sync folders to the devices of your choice.

Individuals can use up to 250 GB. Teams can use up to 100 GB of storage on Keybase.
