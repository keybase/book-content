# Files
Keybase lets you store and share files securely, confidentially, and quickly.

{# Questions: Do we need to specify how much storage people have on Keybase? How about what kinds of files they can upload? What is a “Universal Path” and a “Local Path”? #}

Anything you upload to Keybase is [end-to-end encrypted](link to info about encryption). This means that no one else can read or access your documents (not even Keybase), unless you make them public or to choose to share them with others. If and when someone accesses your files, they can be certain the files were created by you (because they’re automatically [signed](link to info about signing) by you).

You can upload and share files through the Keybase app, Finder (on a Mac), or TK (on Windows). 

Files can be added to folders that have different privacy features: public, private, and team. 

**Public folder** 
Anyone can view files in your public folder (they don’t have to be on Keybase) at https://keybase.pub/TKyourusername. 

You can also turn your public files into a simple, static website. [Learn more about building a website on Keybase](link to Pages content).

**Private folder**
Only you and the people you choose to share with can access files in your private folder. 

To access private files on Keybase, you must have a Keybase account. This means if you share a file with someone who doesn’t have a Keybase account, they have to create one. This is an important security measure that ensures your files are only shared with the people you intend to share them with. It also guarantees to the person you’re sharing with that the files came from you. Phishing scams and malevolent links be banned!

**Team folder**
Files in a team folder can only be accessed by the people on a team or [subteam](link to details on subteams). Files in a team folder cannot be public.

[TK: Something about what Universal Path and Local Path mean for those who are curious and why it might be useful for some people. But if you don’t know what it means and don’t care, you can ignore it.]
