Keybase lets you store and share files securely, confidentially, and quickly. Individuals can store up to 250 GB. Teams and subteams can store up to 100 GB.

Anything you upload to Keybase is automatically [end-to-end encrypted](link to info about encryption). This means that no one else can read or access your files (nope, not even Keybase), unless you make them public or to choose to share them with others. If and when someone accesses your files, they can be 100% certain the files were created by you (because they’re automatically [signed](link to info about signing) by you).

You can access any Keybase file on any computer or device that you use Keybase on. But files won’t take up storage space on your computer or device; they stream in and out on demand.

Files can be organized in folders that have different privacy features: public, private, and team. You can add and organize your own folders within these folders.

**Private**  
Only you and the people you choose to share with can access files in your private folder. 

To access private files on Keybase, you must have a Keybase account. This means if you share a file with someone who doesn’t have a Keybase account, they have to create one. This is an important security measure that ensures your files are only shared with the people you intend to share them with. It also guarantees to the person you’re sharing with that the files came from you. Phishing scams and malevolent links be banned!

**Public**   
Anyone on the internet can view files in your public folder. 

You can also turn your public files into a simple website. [Learn more about building a website on Keybase](link to Sites).

**Team**  
Files in a team folder can only be accessed by the people on a team or [subteam](link to details on subteams). Files in a team folder cannot be public.
