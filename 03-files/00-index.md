# Keybase for Files
Keep and share your most important documents, photos, and videos with Keybase Files.

You can store and share files easily and securely, from any device you use Keybase on. Anything you upload to Keybase is automatically end-to-end encrypted. 

Only the people you choose to share your files with can read or access them (not even Keybase can). If and when someone accesses your files, they can be 100% certain the files were created by you (because they’re automatically signed by you). 

This also means that you can keep private stuff—financial info, NSFW photos, your life philosophy—totally to yourself.

## Sharing and privacy
You can store and share files in public, private, or team folders, each with different privacy features. You can add and organize files and folders any way you like inside these folders.

### Private folders
Only you and the people you choose to share with can access files in your private folders.

To quickly share files with someone on Keybase, just create a new folder and name it like so: `yourusername,theirusername`. Add as many names as you like; all the people named on the folder will automatically have access to it.

If you share a file with someone who doesn’t have a Keybase account, they’ll have to create one. This is an important security measure that ensures your files are only shared with the people you intend to share them with. It also guarantees to the person you’re sharing with that the files came from you. Phishing scams and malevolent links be banned. {# Typo or wordplay? #}

### Public folders
Anyone on the internet can view the files in your public folder. You can also turn your public files into a simple website. Learn more in [Sites](/sites).

### Team folders
A new folder is automatically created for every team to share files in. Files in a team folder can only be accessed by the people on that team. But everyone on a team can access all the files there.

If you want to share files with only specific team members, create a subteam. Learn more in [Teams](/teams).

## Use Finder or Explorer
When you install the Keybase app on your computer, you have a choice to install an integration to make Keybase files automatically appear in Finder (on a Mac) and in Explorer (on Windows). This means you can drag and drop, organize, and delete files right from Finder or Explorer.

## Stream or sync
Your Keybase files won’t take up storage space on your computer or your device because they stream in when you need them and not when you don’t. If you want files to be available when you’re offline, you can sync folders to the devices of your choice.

Individuals can use up to 250 GB, and teams can use up to 100 GB of storage on Keybase.
