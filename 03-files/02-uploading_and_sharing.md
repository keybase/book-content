# Uploading and sharing 
You can upload and share files directly on your computer (via Finder or Macs or Explorer on Windows) or in the app Keybase app via files, teams, or chats. 

## On your computer
On your computer, Keybase is [automatically installed] on Macs in Finder under Favorites and on Windows in Explorer. You can just drag and drop files into the appropriate folder to upload. 

You can also create private shared folders from Finder or Explorer. If you know the Keybase usernames of the people you wish to share with, just open a new private folder and type the usernames of everyone you want to share with (including yourself), separated by a comma. For example, if I wanted to share files with scoates and shiflett, I’d create a folder named sldistin,scoates,shiflett. Scoates and Shiflett will automatically have access to every file in that folder. 

Aaaaannnd, if you don’t know someone’s username or they aren’t on Keybase yet, you can create a file to share with them based on the info you do have, say, their Twitter handle. For example, if you create a folder named TK. TK will automatically get the file when they create a Keybase account.

## In the app
In the app, you can upload and share files by dragging and dropping directly into the appropriate folder in the app. You can also use that big ol’ button with Upload on it.

TK: You can also upload and share files through chat, teams, or with individual people.
